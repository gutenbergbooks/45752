<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In the following chapters it has been my endeavor to
present pictures of the City of London&mdash;instantaneous photographs,
showing the streets, the buildings, and the citizens
at work and at play. Above all, the citizens: with their
daily life in the streets, in the shops, in the churches, and in
the houses; the merchant in the quays and on 'Change;
the shopkeeper of Cheapside; the priests and the monks
and the friars; the shouting of those who sell; the laughter
and singing of those who feast and drink; the ringing of
the bells; the dragging of the criminal to the pillory; the
Riding of the Lord Mayor and Aldermen; the river with its
boats and barges; the cheerful sound of pipe and tabor;
the stage with its tumblers and its rope-dancers; the 'prentices
with their clubs; the evening dance in the streets. I
want my pictures to show all these things. The history of
London has been undertaken by many writers; the presentment
of the city and the people from age to age has never
yet, I believe, been attempted.</p>

<p>The sources whence one derives the materials for such
an attempt are, in the earlier stages, perfectly well known
and accessible to all. Chaucer, Froissart, Lydgate, certain
volumes of the "Early English Text Society," occur to
everybody. But the richest mine, for him who digs after
the daily life of the London citizen during the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries, is certainly Riley's great book of
<i>Extracts from the City Records</i>. If there is any life or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">{vi}</a></span>
any reality in the three chapters of this book which treat of
the Plantagenet period, it is certainly due to Riley.</p>

<p>As regards the Tudor period, the wealth of illustration is
astonishing. One might as well be writing of the city life
of this day, so copious are the materials. But it is not to
Shakespeare and the dramatists that we must look for the
details so much as to the minor writers, the moralists and
satirists, of whom the ordinary world knows nothing.</p>

<p>The reign of Charles II. directs one to the Plague and to
the Fire. I was fortunate in finding two tracts, one dealing
with the plague of 1603, and the other with that of 1625.
These, though they are earlier than Charles II., were invaluable,
as illustrating the effect of the pestilence in causing
an exodus of all who could get away, which took place as
much in these earlier years as in 1666. Contemporary tracts
on the state of London after the Fire, also happily discovered,
proved useful. And when the Plague and the Fire
had been dismissed, another extraordinary piece of good
fortune put me in possession of certain household accounts
which enabled me to present a bourgeois family of the period
at home.</p>

<p>Where there is so much to speak about, one must exercise
care in selection. I have endeavored to avoid as much
as possible those points which have already been presented.
For instance, the growth of the municipality, the rise of
the Guilds and the Companies, the laws of London, the relations
of the City to the Sovereign and the State&mdash;these
things belong to the continuous historian, not to him
who draws a picture of a given time. In the latter case it
is the effect of law, not its growth, which is important.
Thus I have spoken of the pilgrimizing in the time of
Henry II.; of the Mysteries of that time; things that belonged
to the daily life; rather than to matters of policy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">{vii}</a></span>
the stubborn tenacity of the City, or the changes that were
coming over the conditions of existence and of trade.
Again, in Plantagenet London one might have dwelt at
length upon the action taken by London in successive civil
wars. That, again, belongs to the historian. I have contented
myself with sketching the churches and the monasteries,
the palaces and the men-at-arms, the merchants and
the workmen.</p>

<p>Again, in the time of George II., the increase of trade,
which then advanced by leaps and bounds, the widening of
the world to London enterprise, the part which London took
in the conquest of India and the ejection of France from
North America belong to history. For my own part I have
preferred to show the position, the influence, and the work
of the Church at a time generally believed to be the deadest
period in the whole history of the Church of England. This
done, I have gone on to illustrate the day-by-day life of the
citizens, with the prices of things, the management, and the
appearance of the City.</p>

<p>One thing remains to be said. Mr. Loftie, in his <i>History
of London</i> (Stadford), first gave the world a reconstruction
of the ground&mdash;the <i>terrain</i>&mdash;of London and its
environs before ever a house was erected or an acre cleared.
The first chapter of this book&mdash;that on Roman London and
After&mdash;is chiefly due to a study of this map, and to realizing
what that map means when applied to the scanty records
of Augusta. This map enabled me to recover the years
which followed the retreat of the Romans. I cannot allow
this chapter to be called a Theory. It is, I venture to claim
for it, nothing less than a Recovery.</p>

<p>The only real authorities for the events which
took place in Britain during the fifth and sixth
centuries are Gildas and the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>.
There are other writers&mdash;Ethelwerd, for instance, who
copied the <i>Chronicle</i>, and adds nothing; and Nennius,
whose work, edited by one Mark the Hermit in the
tenth century, was found in the Vatican. The first
edition was published in London in the year 1819, in
the original Latin, by the Rev. William Gunn. Nennius
gives a brief account of King Arthur and his exploits,
but he affords little or no information that is
of use to us. The work of Richard of Cirencester is
extremely valuable on account of its topography; it
is also interesting as the work of the first English antiquary.
But he belonged to the fourteenth century,
and has added nothing to the history, of which he
knew no more&mdash;less, indeed&mdash;than we ourselves can
discover. The book named after Geoffrey of Monmouth
is not worth a moment's serious consideration.
In Bede's <i>Ecclesiastical History</i> passages may
be found which throw side lights on this period, but
they are few.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span></p>

<p>Gildas, called Badonicus, is supposed to have been
born in or about the year 520, in Wales. A great mass
of legend has collected about the name of Gildas. He
was the son of a British
kinglet; his three-and-twenty
brothers fought
under King Arthur. He
himself preached, taught,
and in the matter of miracles
was greatly blessed.
He wrote&mdash;if he did
write&mdash;about the year
560, and is therefore contemporary
with the
events of which he
speaks. His book contains
a vast quantity of
rhetoric to a very small
amount of history. Unfortunately
for him, he
was called by his admiring
fellow-monks, in his
lifetime, <i>Sapiens</i>&mdash;the
Wise. Perhaps, in order
to live up to this designation,
he was fain to assume
the garb and language
of a prophet, and,
with what he thought prophetic force, which we
now perceive to be ecclesiastical inflation, he proceeded
to admonish princes and people of their sins.
Every age, to the ecclesiastical prophet as to the secular
satirist, is an age of unbounded profligacy; of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
vice such as the world has never before witnessed; of
luxury advanced to heights hitherto untrodden; of
license, wantonness, riot unbridled and unparalleled,
insomuch that the city of Jerusalem, even when under
the soft influences of Ahola and Aholibah, were really
righteous and pure in comparison. No doubt Gildas
lived in a most trying and most disappointing time.
Things went wrong, and things went steadily from
bad to worse. His people were defeated and driven
continually westward; they could not even hold together
and fight side by side against the common
enemy; religion was forgotten in the fierce struggles
for life, and in the fiercer civil dissensions. As for
the enemy, Saxon, Angle, or Jute, all were alike, in
that none had the least reverence for priest or for
Church; everywhere fighting, defeat, and massacre.
Yet one cannot but think that a lower note might
have been struck with greater advantage; and now
that it is impossible to learn how far the prophet's admonitions
brought repentance to his kings, one regrets
that a simple statement of the events in chronological
order as they occurred was not thought useful or desirable
in a historical work. Would you hear how
the Sapient addresses kings? Listen. He is admonishing
for his good the King of North Wales&mdash;Cuneglass
by name:</p>

<p>"Thou, too, Cuneglass, why art thou fallen into the
filth of thy former naughtiness? Yea, since the first
spring of thy tender youth, thou Bear, thou Rider and
Ruler of many and Guider of the chariot which is the
receptacle of the Bear, thou Contemner of God and
Vilifier of his order! Thou tawny Butcher! Why,
besides thine other innumerable backslidings, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
thrown out of doors thy wife, dost thou, against the
apostle's express prohibition, esteem her detestable
sister, who has vowed unto God everlasting continency,
as the very flower of the celestial nymphs?"</p>

<p>In similar gentle strains he approaches, and delicately
touches upon, the sins of other kings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 352px;"><a name="ROMAN_MARBLE_SARCOPHAGUS_Guildhall" id="ROMAN_MARBLE_SARCOPHAGUS_Guildhall"></a>
<img src="images/page_004.jpg" width="352" height="106" alt="ROMAN MARBLE SARCOPHAGUS (Guildhall)" title="" />
<span class="caption">ROMAN MARBLE SARCOPHAGUS (<i>Guildhall</i>)</span>
</div>

<p>This kind of language is difficult to sustain, and
sometimes leads to contradictions. Thus, in one sentence,
the Sapient speaks of his countrymen as wholly
ignorant of the art of war, and in another he tells
how the flower of the British youth went off to fight
for Maximus.</p>

<p>As regards the alleged luxury of the time, this poor
monk wrote from a dismal cell, very likely of wattle
and daub, certainly draughty and cold; his food was
poor and scanty; his bed was hard; life to him was a
long endurance. The roasted meats, the soft pillows
and cushions, the heated rooms of the better sort,
seemed to him detestable and wicked luxury, especially
when he thought of the Saxons and Jutes overrunning
the ruined country. Of course, in every age the
wealthy will surround themselves with whatever comforts
can be procured. We are in these days, for instance,
advanced to what our ancestors would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
called an inconceivable height of luxury. One would
like to invite the luxurious Cuneglass to spend a day
or two with a young man of the present day. Those
who were neither rich nor free lived hardly, as they
do to this day, but more hardly; those who were
young and strong, even though they were not perhaps
trained to the use of arms, easily learned how to use
them, and when it came to victory or death, they soon
recovered the old British spirit. This is not the place,
otherwise it would be interesting to show what a long
and gallant stand was made by these people whom it
is customary to call cowardly and luxurious&mdash;these
ancestors of the gallant Welsh.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It is manifest that
a period of two hundred years and more of peace,
almost profound, their frontiers and their coasts guarded
for them by the legions of Rome, must have lowered
the British spirit. But the people quickly recovered
it. The Arthurian epic, it is certain, has plenty
of foundation in fact, and perhaps poor King Cuneglass
himself, the Bear and Butcher, wielded a valiant
sword in spite of his family troubles. The Britons
were, it is quite certain, prone to internal dissensions,
which greatly assisted their defeat and conquest. But
they had one bond of union. Their enemies were pagan;
they were Christian. Gildas addresses a nation
of Christians, not a church planted among idolaters.
Christian symbols and emblems have been found everywhere
on the site of Roman towns, not, it is true,
in large quantities, but they are found; while, though
altars have also been found, and pagan emblems and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
statuettes of gods, there are no ruins anywhere in
Britain, except at Bath, of Roman temples. Their
faith, like the Catholicism of the Irish, was their national
symbol. It separated them broadly from their
enemies; it gave them contempt for barbarians. The
faith therefore flourished with great strength and
vigor. But the popular Christianity seems to have
been in Britannia, as everywhere, a very mixed kind
of creed. As in Southern Italy among the peasants
there linger to this day traditions, customs, and superstitions
of paganism which the people call the Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
Faith, so in Britain there lingered among the people
ceremonies and beliefs which the Church vainly tried
to suppress, or craftily changed into Christian observances.
Such things linger still in Wales, though the
traveller regards them not. In the same way the
folk-lore of our own time in our own villages is still
largely composed of the beliefs and superstitions inherited
from our old English&mdash;not British&mdash;ancestors.
What happens is always the same, and must be the
same. In times of religious revolution the common
folk change the name of their God, but not his nature
or his attributes. Apollo becomes the Christ, but in
the minds of the Italian peasants he remains the old
Apollo. The great Sun-God, worshipped under so
many names and with so many attributes, remains in
the hearts of rustics long, long centuries after mass
has been said and the Host has been elevated. Nay,
it has even been said that the mass itself is an adaptation
of pagan ritual to Christian worship. But the
people, whatever their old beliefs, called themselves
Christian, and that one fact enabled them to forget
their jealousies and quarrels in times of emergency,
and sometimes to act together. They were Christian;
their enemies were pagan. It is significant that in
one passage Gildas&mdash;who is quoted by Bede&mdash;reproaches
them for not converting their conquerors,
among whom they lived. This proves, if the fact
wanted proof, (1) that the Britons were not exterminated
by their conquerors; (2) that they were allowed
to continue unmolested in their own religion; and (3)
that they kept it to themselves as a possession of their
own, a consolation in disaster, and a mark of superiority
and dignity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span></p>
<p>One thing is quite clear, that when the Roman legions
finally withdrew, the Britons were left thoroughly
awakened to the fact that if they could not fight
they must perish. They understood once more the
great law of humanity in all ages, that those who
would enjoy in peace must be prepared to fight in
war. They fought, therefore, valiantly; yet not so
valiantly as the stronger race which came to drive
them out.</p>

<p>In particular, however, we have to deal with the
fate of London, which was then Augusta. Let us
first endeavor to lay down the facts. They are to be
drawn from two sources: the first from the meagre
notes of the historians, the second from certain topographical
and geographical considerations. The latter
have never yet been fully presented, and I believe that
the conclusion to be drawn by comparing the double
set of facts will be accepted as irresistible.</p>

<p>The following are the facts related by the <i>Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 443.&mdash;This year the Britons sent over the sea to Rome,
and begged for help against the Picts; but they had none, because
they were themselves warring against Attila, King of the
Huns. And then they sent to the Angles, and entreated the
like of the Ethelings of the Angles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 449.&mdash;Hengist and Horsa, invited by Vortigern, King
of the Britons, landed in Britain on the shore called Wippidsfleet
(Ebbsfleet?), at first in aid of the Britons, but afterwards
they fought against them. King Vortigern gave them land in
the south-east of this county on condition that they should
fight against the Picts. They then fought against the Picts,
and had the victory wheresoever they came. Then they
sent to the Angles, desired a larger force to be sent, and
caused them to be told the worthlessness of the Britons and
the excellence of the land. Then they soon sent thither a
larger force in aid of the others. At that time came men
from three tribes in Germany&mdash;from the Old Saxons, from
the Angles, and from the Jutes. From the Jutes came the
Kentish men and the Wightwarians&mdash;that is, the tribe which
now dwells in Wight, and that race among the West Saxons
which is still called the race of Jutes. From the Old Saxons
came the men of Essex, Sussex, and Wessex. From Anglia,
which has ever since remained waste, betwixt the Jutes and
Saxons, came the men of East Anglia, Middle Anglia, Mercia,
and of Northumbria.</p>

<p>The conquest of England was now virtually completed.
There was fighting at Old Sarum in 552; at
Banbury in 556; at Bedford, at Aylesbury, and at
Benson, in the year 571. One would judge this to be
a last sortie made by the Welsh who had been driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
into the fens. In the year 577 three important places
in the west are taken&mdash;Gloucester, Bath, and Cirencester.
In 584 there was fighting at Fethan-lea (Frethern),
when the victor took many towns and spoils innumerable;
"and wrathful he thence returned to his
own." As late as 596 we hear that the king of
the West Saxons fought, and contended incessantly
against either the Angles (his own cousins), or the
Welsh, or the Picts, or the Scots; and in 607 was
fought the great battle of Chester, in which "numberless"
Welsh were slain, including two hundred priests
who had come to pray for victory.</p>

<p>It is therefore evident that the conquest of the
country took a long time to effect&mdash;not less, indeed,
than two hundred years. First, Kent, with Surrey,
fell; next, Sussex; both before the end of the fifth
century. Early in the sixth century the West Saxons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
conquered the country covered by Hampshire, a part
of Surrey, and Dorsetshire; next, Essex fell, and there
was stubborn fighting for many years in the country
about and beyond the great Middlesex forest. The
conquest of the North concerns us little, save that it
drew off some of those who were fighting in what afterwards
became the Kingdom of Mercia. I desire
to note here only the surroundings of London, and to
mark how, by successive steps of the invaders' march,
it was gradually cut off, bit by bit, from the surrounding
country. Thus, when Kent was overrun, the
bridge gate was closed, the roads south, south-west,
and south-east were blocked, and the whole of that
country cut off from London; at the fall of Essex,
Norfolk, and Suffolk, the eastern gate was closed, and
that great district was cut off. When Wessex was an
established kingdom, the river highway was closed;
there then remained only the western gate, and that,
during the whole of the sixth century, led out into a
country perpetually desolated and destroyed by war,
so that, by the middle of the sixth century, no more
communication whatever was possible between London
and the rest of the country, unless the people
made a sortie and cut their way through the enemy.</p>

<p>Observe, however, that no mention whatever is made
of London in the <i>Chronicle</i>. Other and less important
towns are mentioned. Anderida or Pevensey,
Aquæ Solis or Bath, Gloucester, Chester, and many
others; but of London there is no mention. Consider:
London, though not much greater than other
cities in the country&mdash;York, Verulam, Lincoln, Colchester,
for instance&mdash;was undoubtedly the chief port
of the country. We must not bring modern ideas to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
bear when we read of the vast trade, the immense
concourse of merchants, and so forth. We need not
picture miles of docks and countless masts. Roman
London was not modern Liverpool. Its bulk of trade
was perfectly insignificant compared with that of the
present. When we begin to consider the mediæval
trade of London this will become apparent. Still, it
was, up to the coming of the Saxons, a vigorous and
flourishing place, and the chief port of the country.
Why, therefore, does the <i>Chronicle</i> absolutely pass
over so great an event as the taking of London?</p>

<p>Such is the evidence of history. Let us consider
next the evidence of topography. We shall understand
what happened in London when we understand
the exceptional position of London and the dangers
to which the city in time of civil war was necessarily
exposed.</p>

<p>We will go back to the beginning of all things&mdash;to
the lie of the land on which London was planted.
The reader, if he will consult that very admirable
book, Loftie's <i>History of London</i>, will find in it a most
instructive map. It shows the <i>terrain</i> before the city
was built at all. The river Thames, between Mortlake
on the west and Blackwall on the east, pursued a
serpentine way, in the midst of marshes stretching
north and south. There were marshes all the way.
At spring tides, and at all tides a little above the common,
these marshes were under water; they were always
swampy and covered with ponds; half a dozen
tributary brooks flowed into them and were lost in
them. They varied greatly in breadth, being generally
much broader on the south side than on the
north. On this side the higher land rose up abruptly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
in a cliff or steep hill from twenty to five-and-thirty
feet in height. The cliff, as we follow it from the
east, approached the river, touched it at one point,
and then receded again as it went westward. This
point, where the cliff overhung the river, was the only
possible place where the city could have been founded.</p>

<p>I call it a point, but it consisted of two hillocks,
both about thirty-five feet high, standing on either
side the little stream of Walbrook, where it flows into
the Thames. On one of these hills, probably that on
the west, was a small
fortress of the Britons,
constructed after the
well-known fashion of
hill forts, numberless
examples of which remain
scattered about
the country. On the
other hillock the Roman
city, later on, was
first commenced.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 174px;"><a name="ROMAN_PAVEMENT_LEADENHALL_STREET" id="ROMAN_PAVEMENT_LEADENHALL_STREET"></a>
<img src="images/page_014.jpg" width="174" height="176" alt="ROMAN PAVEMENT: LEADENHALL STREET" title="" />
<span class="caption">ROMAN PAVEMENT: LEADENHALL STREET</span>
</div>

<p>Here, at the beginning
of the city, was
instituted very early a
ferry over the river. On the eastern hill the Romans
built their forum and basilica, with the offices and
official houses and quarters. When foreign trade
began to increase, the merchants were obliged to
spread themselves along the bank. They built quays
and river-walls to keep out the water, and the city
extended laterally to east and west, just as far as was
convenient for the purposes of trade&mdash;that is, not farther
than Fleet River on the west, and the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
site of the Tower on the east. It then began to spread
northward, but very slowly, because a mile of river
front can accommodate a great working population
with a very narrow backing of houses. When the
city wall was built, somewhere about the year 360,
the town had already run out in villas and gardens as
far north as that wall. Outside the wall there was
nothing at all, unless one may count a few scattered
villas on the south side of the river. There was as
yet no Westminster, but in its place a broad and
marshy heath spread over the whole area now covered
by the City of Westminster, Millbank, St. James's
Park, Chelsea, and as far west as Fulham. Beyond
the wall on the north lay dreary, uncultivated plains,
covered with fens and swamps, stretching from the
walls to the lower slopes of the northern hills, and to
the foot of an immense forest, as yet wholly untouched,
afterwards called the Middlesex Forest. Fragments
of this forest yet remain at Hampstead, Highgate,
Epping, and Hainault. All through this period,
therefore, and for long after, the City of London had
a broad marsh lying on the south, another on the
west, a third on the east, while on the north there
stretched a barren, swampy moorland, followed by an
immense impenetrable forest. Later on a portion of
the land lying on the north-west, where is now Holborn,
was cleared and cultivated. But this was later,
when the Roman roads which led out of London ran
high and broad over the marshes and the moors and
through the forest primeval. The point to be remembered
as connected with the marshes is this: Around
most great towns there is found a broad belt of cultivated
ground protected by the wall and the garrison.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
Here the people grow for their own use their grain
and their fruit, and pasture their beasts and their
swine. London, alone among great cities, never had
any such home farm until the marsh was reclaimed.
The cattle, which were driven daily along the roads
into the city, grazed on pastures in Essex farms, beyond
the forest and the River Lea. The corn which
filled her markets came down the river in barges from
the inland country. All the supplies necessary for
the daily food of the city were brought in from the
country round. Should these supplies be cut off,
London would be starved.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 207px;"><a name="BRONZE_BUST_OF_THE_EMPEROR_HADRIAN" id="BRONZE_BUST_OF_THE_EMPEROR_HADRIAN"></a>

<span class="caption">BRONZE BUST OF THE EMPEROR HADRIAN:
FOUND IN THE THAMES
(<i>British Museum</i>)</span>
</div>

<p>These supplies were very large indeed. As said
above, we may set aside as extravagant the talk of a
vast and multitudinous throng of people, as if the
place was already a kind of Liverpool. Augusta
never, certainly, approached the importance of Massilia,
of Bordeaux, of Antioch, of Ephesus. Nor was
Augusta greater than other English towns. The walls
of York enclose as large an area as those of Roman
London. The wall of Uriconium encloses an area
nearly equal to that of Roman London. The area of
Calleva (Silchester), a country town of no great importance,
is nearly half as great as that of Roman London.
But it was a large and populous city. How
populous we cannot even approximately guess. Considering
the extent of the wall, if that affords any
help, we find, counting the river front, that the wall
was two miles and three-quarters in length. This is a
great length to defend. It is, however, certain that
the town when walled must have contained a population
strong enough to defend their wall. The Romans
knew how to build in accordance with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
wants and their resources. If the wall was built three
miles long, there were certainly defenders in proportion.
Now, could so
great a length be intrusted
to a force less
than 20,000? The defenders
of the walls of
Jerusalem, which, after
the taking of the third
wall, were very much
less than two miles in
extent, demanded at
least 25,000 men, as Titus
very well knew.
Now, if every able-bodied
man in London
under the age of five-and-fifty
were called out
to fight, the population,
on the assumption of
20,000 suitable men,
would be about 70,000.
If, on the other hand,
the London citizens after
the departure of the
Romans could man their walls with only 10,000 men,
they would have a population of about 35,000. Now,
the daily needs of a population of only 35,000 are very
considerable. We have, it is true, to supply food for
5,000,000, but the brain is incapable of comprehending
figures and estimates of such vastness. One can better
understand those which have to do with a population
of 30,000 or 40,000. So much bread, so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
meat, so much wine, beer, and fruit. Where did all
these things come from? Nothing, as I have said, from
the immediate neighborhood; chiefly from Surrey and
from Kent; a great deal from Essex; and the rest
from the west country by means of the river.</p>

<p>London, therefore, with a population of not less
than 35,000, and perhaps upwards of 70,000, stood in
the midst of marshes&mdash;marshes everywhere&mdash;marshes
all around except in the north; and there impenetrable
forest. It depended wholly for its supplies, for
its daily bread, for its existence, upon the country
around.</p>

<p>In order to buy these supplies it depended upon its
trade of import and export. It was the only port in
the kingdom; it received the hides, the iron, and the
slaves from inland and embarked them in the foreign
keels; it received from abroad the silks, the spices,
the wines, the ecclesiastical vestments, and all the articles
of foreign luxury, and sent them about the
country.</p>

<p>But this important place changed hands, somehow,
without so much as a mention from the contemporary
records; and while places like Bath, Gloucester,
Cirencester, are recorded as being besieged and taken,
no word is said of London, a place of far greater
importance.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the siege of London was
not followed by a massacre as at Anderida, and that
there was no great battle as at Chester; but that the
place was quietly surrendered and the lives of the
people spared. This is a thing absolutely impossible
during these two centuries. The English invader did
not make war in such a manner. If he attacked a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
town and took it by assault he killed everybody who
did not run away. That was his method: that was
how he understood war. If he pushed out his invading
arms he killed the occupants of the land, unless,
which sometimes happened, they killed him, or, as
more often happened, they ran away. But of making
terms, sparing lives, suffering people to remain in
peaceful occupation of their houses we hear nothing,
because such a thing never happened until the close
of the war, when victory was certain to one side and
resistance was impossible to the other. Mercy was
not as yet in the nature of Angle, Jute, or Saxon.</p>

<p>Suppose, however, that it did happen. Suppose
that after that great rout of Craysford the victorious
army had pushed forward and taken the city, or had
accepted surrender in this peaceful nineteenth-century
fashion, so entirely opposite to their received and
customary method, what would have happened next?</p>

<p>Well, there would have been continuity of occupation.
Most certainly and without doubt this continuity
of occupation would have been proved by many
signs, tokens, and survivals. For instance, the streets.
The old streets would have remained in their former
positions. Had they been burned down they would
have been rebuilt as before. Nothing is more conservative
and more slow to change than an old street.
Where it is first laid out there it remains. The old
lanes which formerly ran between gardens and at the
back of houses, are still the narrow streets of the City.
In their names the history of their origin remains.
In Garlickhithe, Fyfoot Lane, Suffolk Lane, Tower
Royal, Size Lane, Old Jewry, the Minories, and in a
hundred other names, we have the identical mediæval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
streets, with the identical names given to them
from their position and their association. And this
though fire after fire has burned them down, and since
one fire at least destroyed most of them at a single
effort. A Roman town was divided, like a modern
American town, into square blocks&mdash;<i>insulæ</i> (islands)
they were called. Where are the <i>insulæ</i> of London?
There is not in the whole of London a single trace of
the Roman street, if we except that little bit still
called after the name given by the Saxons to a Roman
road.</p>

<span class="caption">A BIT OF ROMAN WALL
<br />
(<i>From a photograph by W. H. Grove, 174 Brompton Road</i>)</span>
</div>

<p>Again, continuity of occupation is illustrated by
tradition. It is impossible for the traditions of the
past to die out if the people continue. Nay, if the
conqueror makes slaves of the former lords, and if
they remain in their servitude for many generations,
yet the traditions will not die. There are traditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
of these ancient times among the Welsh, but among
the Londoners there are none. The Romans&mdash;the
Roman power&mdash;the ferocity of Boadicea, the victorious
march of Theodosius, the conversion of the country,
the now forgotten saints and martyrs of London&mdash;these
would have been remembered had there been
continuity of occupation. But not a single trace remains.</p>

<p>Or, again, continuity of tenure is proved by the survival
of customs. What Roman customs were ever
observed in London? There is not a trace of any.
Consider, however, the customs which still linger
among the Tuscan, the Calabrian, and the Sicilian
peasants. They are of ancient origin; they belong
to the Roman time and earlier. But in London there
has never been a custom or an observance in the least
degree traceable to the Roman period.</p>

<p>Lastly, continuity of tenure is illustrated by the
names of the people. Now, a careful analysis of the
names found in the records of the fourteenth century
has been made by Riley in his <i>Memorials of London</i>.
We need not consider the surnames, which are all derived
from occupation, or place of birth, or some physical
peculiarity. The Christian names are for the
most part of Norman origin; some are Saxon; none
are Roman or British.</p>

<p>It has been advanced by some that the municipal
government of the town is of Roman origin. If that
were so, it would be through the interference of the
Church. But it is not so. I believe that all who
have considered the subject have now acknowledged
that the municipal institutions of London have grown
out of the customs of the English conquerors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span></p>

<p>To sum up, because this is very important. When
in the seventh century we find the Saxons in the possession
of the city there is no mention made of any
siege, attack, capture, or surrender. When, a little
later, we are able to read contemporary history, we
find not a single custom or law due to the survival of
British customs. We find the courses of the old
streets entirely changed, the very memory of the
streets swept away; not a single site left of any ancient
building. Everything is clean gone. Not a
voice, not a legend, not a story, not a superstition remains
of the stately Augusta. It is entirely vanished,
leaving nothing behind but a wall.</p>

<p>Loftie's opinion is thus summed up (<i>London</i>, vol. i.,
p. 54):</p>

<blockquote><p>Roman evidences, rather negative, it is true, than positive to
show that the East Saxons found London desolate, with broken
walls, and a scanty population if any; that they entered on
possession with no great feeling of exultation, after no great
military feat deserving mention in these Chronicles; and that
they retained it only just so long as the more powerful neighboring
kings allowed them. This view is the only one which
occurs to me to account for the few facts we have.</p></blockquote>

<p>And that great antiquary Guest thinks that good
reasons may be given for the belief that London for
a while lay desolate and uninhabited.</p>

<p>The evidence seems to me positive rather than
negative, and, in fact, conclusive. London, I am convinced,
<i>must</i>&mdash;not <i>may</i>, but <i>must</i>&mdash;have remained for
a time desolate and empty.</p>

<span class="caption">LAMPS AND LAMP-STAND</span>
</div>

<p>The evidence is before us, to me clear and unanswerable;
it is furnished by the Chronicle of Conquest,
coupled with the question of supplies. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
city could receive supplies from six approaches. One
of these, called afterwards Watling Street, connected
the city with the north and the west. It entered the
walls at what became, later, Newgate. The second
and third entered near the present Bishopsgate. One
of these, Ermyn Street, led to the north-east, to Norfolk
and Suffolk, the great peninsula, with fens on one
side and the ocean on two other sides; the other, the
Vicinal way, brought provisions and merchandise from
Essex, then and long afterwards thought
to be the garden of England. The bridge
connected the city with the south, while
the river itself was the highway between
London and the fertile counties on either
side the broad valley of the Thames. By
these six ways there were brought into
the city every day a continual supply of
all the necessaries of life and all its luxuries. Along
the roads plodded the pack-horses and the heavy,
grinding carts; the oxen and the sheep and the pigs
were driven to the market; barges floated down the
stream laden with flour, and with butter, cheese,
poultry, honey, bacon, beans, and lentils; and up
the river there sailed with every flood the ships
coming to exchange their butts of wine, their bales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
of silk, their boxes of spice, for iron, skins, and
slaves.</p>

<p>In this way London was fed and its people kept
alive. In this way London has always been fed.
The moorland and swamps all around continued far
down in her history. Almost in the memory of man
there were standing pools at Bankside, Lambeth, and
Rotherhithe. It is not two hundred years since
Moorfields were drained. Wild-fowl were shot on
the low-lying lands of Westminster within the present
century. The supplies came from without. They
were continuous. It is impossible to keep in store
more provisions&mdash;and those only of the most elementary
kind&mdash;than will last for a short period. There
may have been a city granary, but if the supplies were
cut off, how long would its contents continue to feed
a population, say, of thirty-five thousand?</p>

<p>Four points, in short, must be clearly understood:</p>

<p>(1) London was a port with a great trade, export
and import. To carry on this trade she employed a
very large number of men&mdash;slaves or free men.</p>

<p>(2) If she lost her trade her merchants were ruined,
and her people lost their work and their livelihood.</p>

<p>(3) The lands immediately round London&mdash;beneath
her walls&mdash;produced nothing. She was therefore
wholly dependent on supplies from without.</p>

<p>(4) If these supplies failed, she was starved.</p>

<p>Now you have seen the testimony of history. The
port of London closed by the ships of the Kentish
and the Essex shores; communications with the country
gradually cut off; first, with the south; next, with
the east; then, by the river; lastly, by the one gate
which still stood open, but led only into a country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
ravaged by continual war, and overrun by an enemy
who still pushed the Britons farther west. There was
no longer any trade; that, indeed, began to languish
in the middle of the fifth century; there were no longer
either exports or imports. When there were no
longer any supplies, what happened? What must
have happened?</p>

<p>Let me consider the history from a contemporary
Londoner's point of view. The <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>
is written from the conqueror's view; the prophecies
of Gildas take the ecclesiastical line, that misfortunes
fall upon a nation because of their wickedness,
which is perfectly true if their wickedness leads them
to cowardly surrender or flight, but not otherwise, or
else the Saxons, whose wickedness, if you come to
look at it, was really amazing, would themselves have
been routed with great slaughter, and smitten hip and
thigh. There are sins and sins. Those which do not
corrupt a nation's valor do not cause a nation's fall.</p>

<p>This is what the man of London saw. It is a hitherto
unpublished chapter from the Chronicle of a layman,
a British citizen:</p>

<p>"The Legions left us. They had gone away before,
but returned at our solicitations to drive back
the Picts and Scots who overran the land (but reached
not the walls of London). This done, they went away
for good. And now, indeed, we understood that our
long security was over, and that we must arise and
defend ourselves, or meet with the fate that overtakes
the weak and cowardly. They put up for us a wall
before they went away, but the wall availed not long.
No walls are of any avail unless there be valiant defenders
behind. Then the enemy once more overran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
the country. To them were joined pirates from Ireland.
Thus the land of Britain seemed given over to
destruction, especially in the North and West. The
merchants who traded with these parts were now
driven to sore straits, because no goods came to them
from their friends, nor were those who were once
wealthy able to purchase any more the luxuries which
had formerly been their daily food. But in the lands
east and south, and that part of the country lying
east of the fenny country, the people were free from
alarms, and feared nothing, being protected by the sea
on one hand and the fens on the other; so that we
in London looked on with disquiet, it is true, but not
with alarm. Nay, the situation looked hopeful when
our people, recovering their spirit, drove out the enemy,
and once more sat down to cultivate the lands.
For a few years there was peace, with plentiful harvests
and security. Then our trade again revived,
and so great was the quantity of corn, hides, iron, and
tin which was brought to our ports and shipped for
foreign countries that the old prosperity of Augusta
seemed destined to be doubled and trebled. Many
merchants there were&mdash;wise men and far-seeing&mdash;who
taught that we should take advantage of this respite
from the greed and malice of our enemies to imitate
the Romans, and form legions of our own, adding that
the island wanted nothing but security to become a
great treasure-house or garden, producing all manner
of fruit, grain, and cattle for the maintenance and enrichment
of the people. This counsel, however, was
neglected.</p>

<p>"Then there fell upon the country a plague which
carried off an immense number. The priests said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
the plague, as well as the Pict and the Scot, came
upon us as a visitation for our sins. That may be,
though I believe our chief and greatest sin was that
of foolishness in not providing for our own defence.</p>

<p>"Now we had long been troubled, even when the
Count of the Saxon Shore guarded our coasts, by
sudden descents of pirates upon our shores. These
devils, who had fair hair and blue eyes, and were of
greater stature than our own people, carried swords a
yard long, and round wooden shields faced with
leather. Some of them also had girdle daggers and
long spears. They were extremely valiant, and, rushing
upon their foes with shouts, generally bore them
down and made them run. They seemed to know,
being guided by the Evil One, what places were least
defended and therefore most open to attack. Hither
would they steer their keels, and landing, would
snatch as much pillage as they could, and so sail home
with loaded vessels, at sight of which their brothers
and their cousins and all the ravenous crew hungered
to join in the sport.</p>

<p>"In an evil moment, truly, for Britannia, our King
invited these people to help in driving off the other
enemies. They willingly acceded. So the lion willingly
accepts the protection of the flock and drives
off the wolves. This done, he devours the silly sheep.
Not long after a rumor reached the Bridge that the
Jutes had arrived in great numbers and were warring
with the men of Cantia. This news greatly disquieted
the City, not only because from that country,
which was rich and populous, great quantities of food
came to the City, with grain and hides for export, but
also because the fleets on their way passed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
the narrow waters between Ruim, which the Jutes
call the Isle of Thanet, and the main-land, on their
way to Rutupiæ and thence across the sea to Gallia.
The rumor was confirmed; and one day there came
into the City across the Bridge, their arms having
been thrown away, the defeated army, flying from the
victorious Jutes. After this we learned every day of
the capture and destruction of our rich ships in the
narrow waters above-named, insomuch that we were
forced to abandon this route and to attempt the
stormy seas beyond the cliffs of Ruim; and the perils
of our sailors were increased, with the risk of our merchants,
insomuch that prayers were offered in all the
churches; and those who divined and foretold the
future, after the manner of the old times before the
light of the Gospel shone upon us, came forth again
and were consulted by many, especially by those who
had ships to sail or expected ships to arrive. The
priests continually reproached us with our sins and
exhorted us to repentance, whereof nothing came, unless
it were the safety of the souls of those who repented.
But while one or two counselled again that
we should imitate the Romans and form legions of
our own, others were for making terms with the enemy,
so that our trade might continue and the City
should grow rich. In the end we did nothing. We
did not repent, so far as I could learn, but who knows
the human heart? So long as we could we continued
to eat and drink of the best, and we formed no legions.</p>

<p>"Why should I delay? Still the invaders flocked
over. Of one nation all came&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;leaving
a desert behind. In the year of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
Lord 500, the whole of the east and most of the south
country were in the hands of this new people. Now
this strange thing has been observed of them. They
love not towns, and will not willingly dwell within
walls for some reason connected with their diabolical
religion; or perhaps because they suspect magic.
Therefore, when they conquered the country, they
occupied the lands indeed, and built thereon their
farm-houses, but they left the towns deserted. When
they took a place they utterly burned and destroyed
it, and then they left it, so that at this day there are
many once rich and flourishing towns which now
stand desolate and deserted. For instance, the city
and stronghold of Rutupiæ, once garrisoned by the
Second Legion; this they took and destroyed. It is
reported that its walls still stand, but it is quite deserted.
So also Anderida, where they massacred every
man, woman, and child, and then went away, leaving
the houses in ashes and the dead to the wolves;
and they say that Anderida still stands deserted. So,
also, Calleva Atrebatum, which they also destroyed,
and that, too, stands desolate. So, too, Durovernum,
which they now call Cantwarabyrig. This they destroyed,
and for many years it lay desolate, but is
now, I learn, again peopled. So, too, alas! the great
and glorious Augusta, which now lies empty, a city
lone and widowed, which before was full of people.</p>

<p>"When Cantia fell to the Jutes we lost our trade
with that fair and rich province. When the East
Saxons and the Angles occupied the east country, and
the South Saxons the south, trade was lost with all
this region. Then the gates of the Vicinal Way and
that of the Bridge were closed. Also the navigation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
of the Lower Thames became full of danger. And
the prosperity of Augusta daily declined. Still there
stood open the great highway which led to the middle
of Britannia and the north, and the river afforded a
safe way for barges and for boats from the west. But
the time came when these avenues were closed. For
the Saxons stretched out envious hands from their
seaboard settlements, and presently the whole of this
rich country, where yet lived so many great and
wealthy families, was exposed to all the miseries of
war. The towns were destroyed, the farms ruined,
the cattle driven away. Where was now the wealth
of this famous province? It was gone. Where was
the trade of Augusta? That, too, was gone. Nothing
was brought to the port for export; the roads
were closed; the river was closed; there was nothing,
in fact, to send; nay, there were no more households
to buy the things we formerly sent them. They lived
now by the shore and in the recesses of the forest,
who once lived in great villas, lay on silken pillows,
and drank the wine of Gaul and Spain.</p>

<p>"Then we of the City saw plainly that our end was
come; for not only there was no more trade, but there
was no more food. The supplies had long been scanty,
and food was dear; therefore those who could no longer
buy food left the town, and sallied forth westward,
hoping to find a place of safety, but many perished of
cold, of hunger, and by sword of the enemy. Some
who reached towns yet untaken joined the warriors,
and received alternate defeat and victory, yet mostly
the former.</p>

<p>"Still food became scarcer. The foreign merchants
by this time had all gone away; our slaves deserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
us; the wharves stood desolate; a few ships without
cargo or crew lay moored beside our quays; our
churches were empty; silence reigned in the streets.
Now, had the enemy attacked the City there would
have been no resistance, but no enemy appeared. We
were left alone&mdash;perhaps forgotten. The marshes and
moors which surround the City on all sides became
our protection. Augusta, to the invader, was invisible.
And she was silent. Her enmity could do no
harm, and her friendship could do no good. She was
full of rich and precious things; the Basilica and the
Forum, with the columns and the statues, stood in the
midst; the houses contained pictures, books, baths,
costly hangings; yet the Saxon wanted none of these
things. The City contained no soldiers, and therefore
he passed it by, or even forgot its existence.</p>

<p>"There came the day when no more provisions
were left. Then those who were left, a scanty band,
gathered in the Basilica, and it was resolved that we
should leave the place, since we could no longer live
in it. Some proposed to try escape by sea, some by
land. I, with my wife and children, and others who
agreed to accompany me, took what we could of food
and of weapons, leaving behind us the houses where
our lives had been so soft and happy, and went out
by the western gate, and taking refuge where we could
in the forest, we began our escape. Mostly we travelled
by night; we passed burning towns and flaming
farmsteads; we encountered hapless fugitives more
naked and miserable than ourselves. But finally we
arrived in safety at the town of Glevum, where we
have found shelter and repose.</p>

<p>"Every year our people are driven westward more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
and more. There seems no frontier that will stop
them. My sons have fallen in battle; my daughters
have lost their husbands; my grandchildren are taught
to look for nothing but continual war. Should they
succeed in reaching our City, the old will perish; but
the young may take flight across the river Sabrina,
and even among the mountains of the West&mdash;their
last place of flight. Should they be driven from the
hills, it will be into the sea. And of Augusta have I
learned nothing for many years. Wherefore am I sure
that it remains desolate and deserted to this day."</p>

<p>The writer of this journal, most valuable and interesting&mdash;even
unique&mdash;was not quite right. Not all
the inhabitants of Augusta went away. In the city a
remnant was left&mdash;there is always a remnant. Some
of them were slaves. All of them were of the baser
sort, whose safety, when cities are taken by assault
and massacres are abroad, lies in their abject poverty
and in the dens wherein they crouch. These remained;
there were not many of them, because hunger
had already driven away most. When the rest were
gone they came out of their holes and looked about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
them, irresolute. Seeing no enemy, they hastily shut
and barred the city gates and sat down fearful. But
days passed, and no attack was made upon them.
Then they began to take courage, and they presently
bethought them that the whole town was their own
to plunder and to pillage. They began, therefore,
with great joy to collect together the things which
the people had been unable to carry with them&mdash;the
sacred vessels from the churches and the rich embroidered
robes of silk worn by the priests. They found
soft stuffs in the villas, with which they wrapped themselves;
they found curtains, rich hangings, pillows,
cushions, carpets&mdash;all of which they took. The carved
work and statues, books, pictures, and things which
they understood not they broke in pieces or burned.
They carried off their plunder to the houses on the
river-side&mdash;the quarter which they chose as handy to
their boats in case of an alarm and convenient for fishing&mdash;on
which they now placed their chief reliance
for food. When they found that no one molested
them they ventured out into the Northern forest,
where they trapped the deer and the boar. Their
thin veneer of civilization was speedily lost: when
they had used up all the fine clothes, when they had
burned up all the wood-work in the place, when the
roofs of their houses fell in, they went back to quite
the ancient manner; they made a circular hut with a
fire in the middle of it, around which they crouched.
They had no more blankets and woollen cloaks, but
they did very well with a wild beast's skin for dress.
Their religion slipped away and was forgotten; indeed,
that was the first thing to go. But, which was
strange, they had not even kept the remembrance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
their ancestors' worship. If they had any religion at
all, it was marked by cruel sacrifices to a malignant
unseen being.</p>

<p>By this time nothing remained of the old houses
but their walls, and these, disintegrated by frost and
rain, were mostly ready to fall; the gardens of the
villas, the beautiful gardens in which their owners
took so much delight, were choked and overgrown
with nettles and brambles; the mosaic pavements
were covered up with rubbish and mould.</p>

<span class="caption">ROMAN KEYS (<i>Guildhall</i>)</span>
</div>

<p>How long did this go on? For fifty years or more.
The rude survivors of Augusta and their children
lived neglected and forgotten, like the Arabs in the
ruins of Palmyra. Outside they knew that a fierce
enemy roamed the country; sometimes they could see
a band of them on the southern bank gazing curiously
at the silent and deserted walls of the City. But
these warriors cared nothing for cities, and shuddered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
suspecting magic at the sight of the gray wall, and
went away again.</p>

<p>One day, however, because nothing remains always
undiscovered, there came along the great Vicinal Way
so tough and strong, on which the tooth of Time
gnawed in vain, a troop of East Saxons. They were
an offshoot, a late arrival, a small colony looking
about if haply they could find or conquer a convenient
place of settlement not yet held by their own
people. They marched along the road, and presently
saw before them the gray walls of the City, with its
gates and bastions. It was a city of which they had
heard&mdash;once full of people, now, like so many others,
a waste chester. It was of no use to them; they
wanted a place convenient for farming, not a place
encumbered with ruins of houses; a place where they
could set up their village community and grow their
crops and keep their cattle. The first rush and fury
of battle were now over. The East Saxons were at
peace, the enemy being either driven away or killed.
A single generation of comfort and prosperity had
made the people milder in temper. They desired no
longer to fight and slay. What, however, if they were
to visit the City?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;"><a name="TOILET_ARTICLES" id="TOILET_ARTICLES"></a>

</div>

<p>The gate was closed. They blew their horns and
called upon the people, if there were any, to surrender.
There was no answer. No arrow was shot from the
walls, not a stone was thrown, not a head was seen
upon the bastion. Then they plied their axes upon
the crumbling wood until the gate gave way and fell
backward with a crash. Shouting, the men of Essex
ran forward. But they soon ceased to shout. Within
they found a deserted city; the walls of what had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
been stately villas stood in broad gardens, but the
houses were roofless, the pictured pavements were
broken or covered up, the fountains were choked, the
walls were tottering. The astonished warriors pressed
forward. The ruined villas gave way to crumbling
remains of smaller houses standing close together.
The streets showed signs of traffic in deep ruts worn
by the cart-wheels. Grass grew between the stones.
Here and there stood buildings larger than the houses;
they, too, were roofless, but over the lintels were
carved certain curious emblems&mdash;crosses and palm-branches,
lambs, vine leaves, and even fish&mdash;the meaning
of which they understood not. Then the men
reached the river-side. Here there had also been a
wall, but much of it was broken down; and here they
found certain circular huts thatched. Within, the fire
was still burning in the middle of the hut. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
were signs of hurried departure&mdash;the fish was still in
the frying-pan, the bed of dried leaves still warm.
Where were the people?</p>

<p>They were gone. They had fled in affright. When
they heard the shouts of the Saxons, they gathered
together their weapons and such things as they could
carry, and they fled. They passed out by the gate of
that road which their conquerors afterwards called
Watling Street. Outside the City they turned northward,
and plunged for safety into the pathless forest,
whither the enemy would not follow.</p>

<p>When these Saxons found that the walled area contained
nothing that was of the least use to them they
simply went away. They left it quite alone, as they
left the places which they called Pevensey, Silchester,
Porchester, and Richborough, and as they left many
other waste chesters.</p>

<p>Then Augusta lay silent and dead for a space.</p>

<p>Presently the fugitives crept back and resumed their
old life among the ruins and died peacefully, and were
followed by their children.</p>

<p>How, then, did London get settled again?</p>

<p>The times became peaceful: the tide of warfare
rolled westward; there were no more ships crossing
with fresh invaders; there were no more pirates hovering
about the broad reaches of the Lower Thames.
The country round London on all sides&mdash;north, south,
east, and west&mdash;was settled and in tranquillity. The
river was safe. Then a few merchants, finding that
the way was open, timidly ventured up the river with
wares such as might tempt those fair-haired savages.
They went to the port of which the memory survived.
No one disputed with them the possession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
grass-grown quays; there were no people, there was
no market, there were no buyers. They then sent
messengers to the nearest settlements; these&mdash;the
first commercial travellers, the first gentlemen of the
road&mdash;showed spear-heads of the finest, swords of the
stoutest, beautiful helmets and fine shields, all to be
had in exchange for wool and hides. The people
learned to trade, and London began to revive. The
rustics saw things that tempted them; new wants,
new desires were created in their minds. Some of
them went into the town and admired its life, how
busy it was, how full of companionship; and they
thought with pity of the quiet country life and the
long days all alone in the fields; they desired to stay
there; others saw the beauty of the arts, and were attracted
by natural aptitude to learn and practise them.
Others, quicker witted than the rest, perceived how
by trade a man may live without his own handiwork
and by the labor of his brother man. No discovery
ever was made more important to the world than this
great fact. "You, my brother," said this discoverer,
"shall continue to dig and to toil, in hot weather or
cold; your limbs shall stiffen and your back shall be
bent; I, for my part, will take your work and sell
it in places where it is wanted. My shoulders will
not grow round, nor will my back be bent. On the
contrary, I shall walk jocund and erect, with a laughing
eye and a dancing leg, when you are long past
laugh or saraband. It is an excellent division of labor.
To me the market, where I shall sit at ease
chaffering with my wares and jesting with my fellows
and feasting at night. To you the plough and the
sickle and the flail. An excellent division."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span></p>

<p>Then more merchants
came, and yet
more merchants, and
the people began to
flock in from the country
as they do now;
and London&mdash;Augusta
being dead&mdash;set
her children to work,
making some rich, for
an example and a
stimulus&mdash;else no one
would work&mdash;and
keeping the many
poor&mdash;else there
would be no chance
for the few to get
rich. And she has
kept them at work
ever since. So that
it came to pass when
Bishop Mellitus, first
of the bishops of London, came to his diocese in the
year 604, he found it once more a market and a port
with a goodly trade and a crowd of ships and a new
people, proud, turbulent, and independent.</p>

<p>So began and so grew modern London.</p>

<p>To the old Rome it owes nothing, not so much as
a tradition. Later, when another kind of influence
began, London learned much and took much from
Rome; but from Augusta&mdash;from Roman London&mdash;nothing.
Roman traditions, Roman speech, Roman
superstitions linger yet among the southern Spaniards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
though the Moor conquered and held the country for
six hundred years. They linger, in spite of many
conquests, in France, in Italy (north and south), in
Roumania, in Anatolia. In London alone, of all the
places which Imperial Rome made her own, and kept
for hundreds of years, no trace of ancient Rome remains.
When London next hears of the Eternal
City it is Rome of the Christian Church.</p>

<p>Compare the conquest of London by the men of
Essex with that of Jerusalem by Titus. The latter
conqueror utterly destroyed the city, and drove out
its people. One might have expected the silence of
Silchester or Pevensey. No, the people crept back
by degrees; the old traditions remained and still remain.
Behind the monkish sites are those familiar to
the common people. Here is the old place of execution&mdash;the
monks knew nothing of that&mdash;here is the
valley of Hinnom; here that of Kedron. These memories
have not died. But of the old Augusta nothing
at all remains. Not a single tradition was preserved
by the scanty remnant of slaves which survived the
conquest; not a single name survives. All the streets
have been renamed&mdash;nay, their very course has been
changed. The literature of the City, which, like Bordeaux,
had its poets and its schools of rhetoric, has
disappeared; it has vanished as completely as that of
Carthage. All the memories of four hundred years
have gone; there is nothing left but a few fragments
of the old wall, and these seem to contain but little
of the Roman work: an old bath, part of the course
of an ancient street, and the fragment which we call
London Stone. Perhaps some portions of the Roman
river-wall have been unearthed, but this is uncertain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span></p>

<p>One fact alone has been considered to suggest that
some of the old Roman buildings remained and were
used again for their old purposes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 458px;"><a name="ROMAN_AMPHORAE" id="ROMAN_AMPHORAE"></a>
<img src="images/page_041.jpg" width="458" height="244" alt="ROMAN AMPHORÆ" title="" />
<span class="caption">ROMAN AMPHORÆ</span>
</div>

<p>In the oldest part of the City, that which lies along
the river-bank, the churches are mostly dedicated to
the apostles. Those which stand farther inland are
dedicated to local and later saints&mdash;St. Dunstan, St.
Botolph, St. Osyth, St. Ethelburga, for instance. But
among those along the river are the churches of St.
Peter, St. Paul, St. Mary, St. Stephen, St. Michael.
It is therefore suggested, but with hesitation, that
when the East Saxons took possession they found the
Roman basilicas still standing; that when they became
converted they learned the original purpose of
their churches and the meaning of the emblems; that
they proceeded to rebuild them, preserving their dedications,
and made them their own churches. This
may be so, but I do not think it at all likely. It is
possible, I say, but not probable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span></p>

<p>You have heard the story how Augusta disappeared,
and how the East Saxons found it deserted, and how
London was born, not the daughter of Augusta at all.
Augusta was childless.</p>


<h3><i>APPENDIX TO CHAPTER I</i></h3>

<blockquote><p>The principal Roman buildings consisted of a bridge, a wall,
a fort at either end of this bridge, and two ports&mdash;Queenhithe
and Billingsgate. No one knows when the bridge was built:
the wall was not erected until some time between <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 350 and
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 369. At that time the area enclosed by the wall was covered
with villas and gardens. The wall has been traced with
certainty, and portions either of the original wall or the mediæval
repairs have been found in many places, and may still be
seen above-ground. The Roman remains which have been dug
up consist of mosaic pavements, sepulchral cists, keys, toilet articles,
lamps, fibulæ, amphoræ, domestic things, and a few
bronze statuettes. Nothing whatever has been found to show
that Augusta was ever a great city, in the sense that Massilia,
Ephesus, Bordeaux, or Alexandria was great.</p></blockquote>

<span style="font-size: 75%;">SAXON AND NORMAN</span></h2>


<p>The citizens of New London&mdash;Augusta having
thus perished&mdash;-were from the outset a people of
mixed race. But the Saxons, and especially the East
Saxons, prevailed. Strangely, it is Essex which has
always prevailed in London. The modern Cockney
dialect, which says "laidy" and "baiby" for lady and
baby, and "whoy" and "hoigh" for why and high, is
pure Essex: you can hear it spoken all over the country
districts of that little-visited county: it is a dialect
so strong that it destroys all other fashions of speech,
even the burr of Cumberland and the broad drawl of
Devonshire. Saxon London was mainly East Saxon.
But, besides the new owners of London, there was,
first of all, some remnant of the scattered Welsh. I
do not mean the miserable survivors of Augustan
London, found in the place when it was first entered,
but those Britons who had taken refuge in the forests
of Surrey, Sussex, and Middlesex, and there lived as
they could, until they could safely venture forth
among their conquerors. Gildas, as we have seen,
speaks of these people; and their skulls remain in the
Saxon cemeteries to prove how great a Celtic element<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
survived among the English conquerors. Next, there
were the foreign merchants. This class formed a considerable
proportion of the better class; and it grew
larger every day, because the East Saxon was certainly
not so sharp in affairs as the "man of Rouen;" nor
was he in business capacity equal to the Fleming and
the German. But as happens, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, at
the present day, those who were Flemings and the
men of Rouen, speaking their own language, under
Ethelred, had all become Londoners, speaking the
English tongue, under Henry Beauclerk.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a complete revolution in his manners
and customs for the East Saxon when he exchanged
his village community for a walled town.
Consider: at first he lived retired in the country, farming
and cattle-breeding, banded with other families
for safety; he kept up the customs of his fatherland,
he carried on no trade, he suffered the old towns to
fall into ruin; his kinglet had no capital, but roamed
about from place to place, administering justice in the
royal wagon; he enjoyed a ferocious and blood-thirsty
religion suiting his savage disposition; he knew only
the simplest arts; he could till the ground, grind his
corn, brew beer and mead, and work a little in metals;
his women could spin; he knew no letters; he looked
for nothing better than ever-recurring war, with intervals
of peace and feasting; to die on a battle-field
was an enviable lot, because it carried him away to
everlasting happiness. Look at the same man four
hundred years later. He is now a Christian; he is, in
a way, a scholar; he is an architect, an artist, an illuminator,
a musician, a law-maker, a diplomatist, an artificer,
a caster of bells, a worker in gold and silver;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
he carries on fisheries; he is a merchant; he builds
ships; he founds trade-guilds&mdash;he is as far removed
from the fierce warrior who leaped ashore at Thanet
as the Romano-Briton whom he conquered was removed
from the naked savage who opposed the arms
of Cæsar.</p>

<p>The difference is chiefly due to his conversion.
This has brought him under the influence of Rome
Ecclesiastic. It has educated him, turned him into a
townsman, and made growth
possible for him. No growth
is possible for any race until
it first accepts the creed of
civilization.</p>

</div>

<p>London was converted in
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 604. This was a hasty
and incomplete conversion,
executed to order; for the
citizens speedily relapsed.
Then they were again converted,
and in sober earnest
put away their old gods,
keeping only a few of the
more favorite superstitions;
some of these remain still with us. They were so
thoroughly converted that the city of London become
a veritable mother of saints. There was the
venerable Erkenwald, saint and bishop, he who built
Bishopsgate on the site of the old Roman gate. There
was St. Ethelburga, the wife of Sebert, the first
Christian king; her church still stands, though not
the earliest building, close beside the site of the old
gate. There was St. Osyth, queen and martyr, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
mother of King Offa; her name also survives in Size,
or St. Osyth's, Lane, but the Church of St. Osyth was
rededicated to St. Ben'et Sherehog (Benedict Skin-the-Pig);
you may see the little old church-yard still,
black and grimy, surrounded on three sides by tall
houses. English piety loved to dedicate churches to
English saints&mdash;more likely these than Italian or
French&mdash;to look after the national interests. Thus
there were in London churches dedicated to St.
Dunstan, St. Swithin, St. Botolph (whose affection
for the citizens was so well known that it was recognized
by four churches), St. Edmund the Martyr, and,
later on, when the Danes got their turn, churches to
St. Olaf and St. Magnus.</p>

<p>The Englishman, thus converted, was received into
the company of civilized nations. Scholars came
across the Channel to teach him Latin, monks came
to teach him the life of self-sacrifice, obedience, submission,
and abstinence. The monastery reared its
humble walls everywhere; the first foundation of the
first bishop of London was a monastery. In times of
war between the kinglets&mdash;when were there no wars?&mdash;the
monasteries, after the whole country had been
converted, were spared. Therefore the people settled
around them, and enjoyed their protection. The monastery
towns grew rapidly and prospered. New arts
were introduced and taught by the monks, new ideas
sprang up among the people, new wants were created.
Moreover, intercourse began with other nations&mdash;the
ecclesiastic who journeyed to Rome took with him a
goodly troop of priests, monks, and laymen; they saw
strange lands and observed strange customs. Some of
them learned foreign languages, and even made friendships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
with the men who spoke them, discovering that
a man who speaks another tongue is not necessarily
an enemy. The Englishman was changed; yet he
remained still, as he always does, whether he creates
a new empire in America, or one in Australia, always
an Englishman.</p>

<p>Meantime the kinglets made war with each other,
and London became a prize for each in turn. It
passed from the East Saxon to the Northumbrian, to
the Mercian, to the West Saxon, as the hegemony
passed from one to the other. Each kinglet learned
more and more to recognize its importance and its
value. One of the oldest civic documents extant is a
grant of King Ethelbald to the Bishop of Rochester.
He gives him the right of passing one ship of his own,
or of another's, free of toll into the port of London.
The toll of incoming and outgoing vessels formed,
therefore, part of the royal revenue.</p>

<p>The history of London between <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 600 and the
Norman Conquest is the history of England. How
the City fell into the hands of the Danes, how it was
finally secured by Alfred, how the Danes again obtained
the City without fighting, and how the Norman
was received in peace, belong to history. All this
time London was steadily growing. Whatever king
sat on the throne, her trade increased, and her wealth.</p>

<p>The buildings, till long after the Norman Conquest,
were small and mean: the better houses were timber
frames, with shutters or lattices, but no glass for the
windows; the poorer houses were of wattle and daub.
The churches were numerous and small. Some of
them were still of wood, though a few were built of
stone, with the simple circular arch. The first church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
of St. Paul's was destroyed by fire, a fate which awaited
the second and the third. By the time of Edward the
Confessor the second church was completed; but of
this church we have no record whatever. The Saxon
period, as concerns London, is the darkest of any.
You may see at the Guildhall nearly everything that
remains of Roman London. But there is nothing,
absolutely not one single stone, to illustrate Saxon
London. The city which grew up over the deserted
Augusta and flourished for four hundred years has entirely
disappeared. Nothing is left of it at all. The
chief destroyer of Saxon London was the great fire
of 1135, which swept London from end to end as effectually
as that of 1666. Had it not been for these
two fires, we should very likely have still standing one
or two of the sturdy little Saxon churches of which
the country yet affords one surviving example. Yet
London is not alone in having no monuments of this
period. If we take any other town, what remains in
it of the years <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 600-1000? What is left in Rome
to mark the reigns of the eighty Popes who fill that
period? What in Paris to illustrate the rule of the
Carlovingians? Fire and the piety of successive generations
have destroyed all the buildings.</p>

<p>For outside show the city of Edward the Confessor
and that of the second Henry were very nearly the
same, and so may be treated together. The churches
burned down in 1135 were rebuilt in stone, but the
houses presented much the same appearance. Now,
everybody who speaks of Norman London must needs
speak of William Fitz Stephen. He is our only authority;
all that we can do is to make commentaries
and guesses based on the text of Fitz Stephen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span></p>

<p>He was a clerk in the service of Thomas à Becket;
he was present at the archbishop's murder; he wrote
a Life of the saint, to which he prefixed, by happy inspiration,
a brief eulogy of the City of London. It is
far too brief, but it contains facts of the most priceless
importance. London, we learn, possessed, besides
its great cathedral, thirteen large conventual churches
and one hundred and twenty-six parish churches.
The White Tower was already built on the east side;
the walls of the City, now kept in good repair, encircled
it on all sides except the river; here the wall
which had formerly defended the river front had been
taken down to make way for warehouses and quays;
the Royal Palace stood without the City, but connected
with it by a populous suburb. Those who
lived "in the suburbs"&mdash;that is, about Chancery Lane
and Holborn&mdash;had spacious and beautiful gardens;
there were also on this side pasture and meadow
lands, with streams and water-mills; beyond the pastures
was a great forest filled with wild creatures; many
springs of water rose on the north side. The City
was so populous that of those who went out to a
muster, 20,000 were chosen as horsemen and 60,000
for the foot. We will discuss the question of population
later on. Meantime one may remark that a force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
of 80,000 always ready to be called out means a population
of 320,000 at least, which is indeed absurd, especially
when we consider that the population of
London, as shown by the poll-tax of Richard II., was
only about 40,000.</p>

<p>There were three principal schools, but sometimes
other schools were opened "by favor and permission."
We are not told what schools these were; but there
was always a school of some kind attached to every
monastery and nunnery. The boys were taught Latin
verse, grammar, and rhetoric; they disputed with each
other in the churches on feast-days, especially about
the "principles of grammar, and the rules of the past
and future tenses"&mdash;truly, an agreeable pastime.</p>

<p>The different trades of the City were allotted their
own places of work and sale. Fitz Stephen does not
name the various quarters, but they can be easily ascertained
from Stow, though the place assigned to
each was sometimes changed. Thus, the chief market
and trading-place of the City was always Cheap, a
broad, open place with booths and sheds for the exposure
of wares, on the north and south. The names
of the streets leading out of Cheap indicate the trades
that were carried on in them. The streets called
Wood, Milk, Iron, Honey, Poultry, mark the site of
certain markets on the north. Those named after
Bread, Candles, Soap, Fish, Money-changing, are
shown on the south. Along the rivers were breweries,
of which one remains to this day; artificers of various
kinds were gathered together in their own streets
about the town. This custom of congregation was useful
in more ways than one: it gave dignity to the craft
and inspired self-respect for the craftsmen, it kept up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
the standard of good work, it made craftsmen regard
each other as brethren, not as enemies; it gave them
guilds, of which our trades-unions, which think of nothing
but wages, are the degenerate successors; and it
brought each trade under the salutary rule of the
Church.</p>

<p>There was then&mdash;there has always been&mdash;a great
plenty of food in the city of London; on the river-bank,
among the vintners, there were eating-houses
where at all times of the day and every day there
were cooked and sold meat and fish and every kind of
food. Once a week, on Friday, there was a horse-fair
in Smithfield without the walls; at this fair there were
races every week.</p>

<p>The young men of the City were greatly addicted
to sports of all kinds: they skated in winter, they tilted
on the water and on land, they fought, wrestled, practised
archery, danced, and sang. They were a turbulent,
courageous, free and independent youth, proud
of their city and its wealth, proud of their power and
their freedom, proud of the trade which came to their
quays from every part of the world. What says Fitz
Stephen?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Aurum mittit Arabs: species et thura Sabæus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arma Scythes: oleum palmarum divite sylva<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pingue solum Babylon: Nilus lapides pretiosos:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Norwegi, Russi, varium grisum, sabelinas:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seres, purpureas vestes: Galli, sua vina."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The good cleric is a little mixed in his geography.
The Arabs certainly had no gold to send; the Sabæans
were, however, Arabs of Saba, in Arabia Felix:
they sent myrrh and frankincense; spices came from
another country. Why does he assign arms to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
Scythians? Egypt had turquoise mines, but no other
precious stones. The purple garments of the Seres,
or Chinaman, are silks. Norway and Russia still send
sables and other furs, and France, happily, still sends
claret.</p>

<blockquote><p>The city (Fitz Stephen adds), like Rome, is divided into
wards, has annual sheriffs for its consuls, has senatorial and
lower magistrates, sewers and aqueducts in its streets&mdash;its
proper places and separate courts for cases of each kind, deliberative,
demonstrative, judicial&mdash;and has assemblies on appointed
days. I do not think there is a city with more commendable
customs of church attendance, honor to God's
ordinances, keeping sacred festivals, almsgiving, hospitality,
confirming betrothals, contracting marriages, celebration of
nuptials, preparing feasts, cheering the guests, and also in care
for funerals and the interment of the dead. The only pests of
London are the immoderate drinking of fools, and the frequency
of fires. To this may be added that nearly all the Bishops,
Abbots, and Magnates of England are, as it were, citizens and
freemen of London, having their own splendid houses to which
they resort, where they spend largely when summoned to great
Councils by the King or by their Metropolitan, or drawn thither
by their own private affairs.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us consider the monuments of the City. There
remains of Saxon London nothing. Of Norman London,
the great White Tower, the crypt of Bow, the
crypt of St. John's Priory (outside the City), part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
the church of Bartholomew the Great, part of St.
Ethelburga's, Bishopsgate; there is nothing more.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The cathedral of St. Paul's when Fitz Stephen
wrote was slowly rising from its ashes. It had been
already twice destroyed by fire. First, the church
founded by Mellitus and beautified by Bishop Cedd
and King Sebbi was burned to the ground in the year
961. We know nothing at all of this building or of
its successor, which was destroyed in the year 1086.
Bishop Maurice began to rebuild the church in the
following year, but it was two hundred years before it
was completed. This cathedral therefore belongs to
a later period. That which was destroyed in 1084
must have resembled in its round arches and thick
pillars the cathedral of Durham.</p>

<p>The church and the various buildings which belonged
to it in the reign of Henry I. were surrounded
by a wall. This wall included the whole area now
known as St. Paul's Church-yard, and as far as Paternoster
Row on the north side. There were six gates
to the wall; the sites of two are preserved in the
names of St. Paul's Alley and Paul's Chain. The
Bishop's Palace was on the north-west corner; the
chapter-house was on the south side of the church;
on the north was a charnel-house and a chapel over
it; close beside this was a small enclosure called Pardon
Church-yard, where a chapel was founded by Gilbert
à Becket, the saint's father. This enclosure was
afterwards converted into a beautiful cloister, painted
with a Dance of Death, called the Dance of St. Paul's.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
Close beside Pardon Church-yard was the chapel of
Jesus, serving for the parish church of St. Faith until
the chapel was destroyed, when the parish obtained
the crypt for its church. St. Faith's is now coupled
with St. Augustine's.</p>

<span class="caption">CRYPT: REMAINS OF THE COLLEGIATE CHURCH
OF ST. MARTIN-LE-GRAND, N.E.</span>
</div>

<p>Of the thirteen large conventual churches mentioned
by Fitz Stephen, we may draw up a tolerably complete
list: St. Martin-le-Grand, St. Katherine's by the
Tower, St. Mary Overies, Holy Trinity Priory, St.
Bartholomew's Priory, St. Giles's Hospital, St. Mary
of Bethlehem, the priory of St. John of Jerusalem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
the nunnery afterwards turned into Elsing's Spital, the
nunnery of St. John Baptist, Hollywell, the nunnery
of Clerkenwell, the new Temple in Fleet Street, and
the old Temple in Holborn, perhaps make up the
thirteen. I cannot believe that Fitz Stephen could
have included either Barking Abbey or Merton Abbey
in his list.</p>

<p>The most ancient monastic foundation, next to that
of St. Paul's, was St. Martin's House or College.
Why St. Martin was so popular in this country, which
had so many saints of her own, is not easily intelligible.
Perhaps the story of the partition of the cloak
at the gate of Amiens, while the saint was still a soldier,
struck the imagination of the people. Certainly
the saint's austerities at Ligujé would not attract the
world. In London alone there were the church of
St. Martin's, Ludgate Hill, said to have been founded
in very early Saxon times, that of St. Martin's
Outwich, of St. Martin Orgar, St. Martin Pomary, and
St. Martin Vintry&mdash;five parish churches to attest his
sanctity and his popularity.</p>

<p>St. Martin-le-Grand, sanctuary and collegiate church,
was a Liberty to itself. Here criminals found safety
and could not be arrested, a privilege which lasted
long after the dissolution of the religious houses.
Among the deans of St. Martin's was William of
Wykeham.</p>

<p>One church only of the whole thirteen still stands.
Part of the present church of St. Bartholomew the
Great is that actually built by Rahere, the first founder,
in the beginning of the twelfth century.</p>

<p>The story of Rahere is interesting but incomplete,
and involved in many difficulties. He is variously said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
to have been the king's minstrel, the king's jester, a
knight of good family, and a man of low origin, who
haunted great men's tables and made them laugh&mdash;nothing
less than the comic person of the period, entirely
given over to the pleasures of the world. In
short, the customary profligate, who presently saw
the error of his ways, and was converted. The last
statement is quite possible, because, as is well known,
there was at this time a considerable revival of religion.
The story goes on to say that, being penitent,
Rahere went on a pilgrimage. Nothing more likely.
At this time, going on pilgrimage offered attractions
irresistible to many men. It was a most agreeable
way of proving one's repentance, showing a contrite
heart, and procuring absolution. It also enabled the
penitent to see the world, and to get a beneficial
change of air, food, and friends. There were dangers
on the way: they lent excitement to the journey;
robbers waylaid those of the pilgrims who had any
money; fevers struck them low; if they marched
through the lands of the infidel, they were often attacked
and stripped, if not slain; the plains of Asia
Minor were white with the bones of those cut off on
their way to the Holy Land. But think of the joy,
to one of an inquiring and curious mind who had
never before been beyond sight of the gray old London
walls, to be travelling in a country where everything
was new&mdash;the speech, the food, the wine, the
customs, the dress&mdash;with a goodly company, the
length of the road beguiled by pleasant talk! Everybody
pilgrimized who could, even the poorest and the
lowest. The poorest could go as well as the richest,
because the pilgrim wanted no money&mdash;he would start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
upon his tramp with an empty scrip. Such an one
had naught to lose, and feared no robbers; he received
bed and supper every night at some monastery, and
was despatched in the morning after a solid breakfast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
When he at length arrived at the shrine for which he
was bound, he repeated the prayers ordered, performed
the necessary crawlings, and heard the necessary
masses; he then returned home, his soul purified,
his sins forgiven, his salvation assured, and his memory
charged with good stories for the rest of his life.
The English pilgrim fared sometimes to Walsingham,
sometimes to Canterbury, sometimes farther afield.
He journeyed on foot through France and Italy to
Rome; he even tramped all across Europe and Asia
Minor, if he could be received in some great company
guarded by the knights of St. John to the Holy Land.
The roads in the eleventh and twelfth centuries were
covered with pilgrims; the Mediterranean was black
with ships going from Marseilles, from Genoa, from
Naples, to the port of St. Jean d'Acre. Even the
rustic, discovering that he, too, simple and unlettered
as he was, had a soul to be saved, and that it would
be better not to trust altogether to the last offices of
the parish priest, threw down his spade, deserted his
wife and his children, and went off on pilgrimage. At
last the bishops interfered, and enjoined that no one
should be considered and received as a pilgrim who
could not produce an episcopal license. It was no
longer enough for a man to get repentance in order to
get the run of the road and of his teeth; and, since
the episcopal license was not granted to everybody,
the rustics had to fall back on what the parish church
afforded, and have ever since been contented with her
advice and authority.</p>

bearded. Let them go from the Vestiary, singing a hymn,
"Jesus, our redemption," advancing with a slow step, through
the right aisle of the Church, as far as the Western gates, and
there stopping, sing a hymn as far as that place, "You shall be
satisfied with my likeness." Then a certain Priest of the higher
stall, written in the table, clothed in an Alb and Amess, barefooted,
carrying a cross upon his right shoulder, with a look cast
downward, coming to them through the right aisle of the
Church, shall suddenly stand between them, and say, "What
are these discourses?" The Pilgrims, as it were, admiring and
looking upon him, shall say, "Are you a stranger?" etc. The
Priest shall answer, "In what city?" The Pilgrims shall answer,
"Of Jesus of Nazareth." The Priest, looking upon both
of them, shall say, "O fools, and slow of heart," which being
said, the Priest immediately shall retire, and pretend to be
going farther; but the Pilgrims hurrying up, and following
him, shall detain him, as it were, inviting him to their inn, and
drawing him with their staves, shall show him a castle and say,
"Stay with us." And so singing they shall lead him as far as
a tent in the middle of the nave of the Church, made in the resemblance
of the Castle Emmaus. When they have ascended
thither, and sat at a table ready prepared, the Lord sitting between
them shall break the bread; and being discovered by
this means, shall suddenly retire, and vanish from their sight.
But they, amazed as it were, rising, with their countenances
turned to each other, shall sing lamentably "Alleluia," with the
verse, "Did not our heart burn," etc., which being renewed,
turning themselves towards the stall, they shall sing this verse,
"Tell us, Mary." Then a certain person of the higher stall,
clothed in a Dalmatick and Amess, and bound round in the
manner of a woman, shall answer, "The Sepulchre of Christ;
the Angels are witnesses." Then he shall extend and unfold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
a cloth from one part, instead of clothes, and throw it before
the great gate of the Choir. Afterwards he shall say, "Christ
is risen." The Choir shall sing two other verses, following, and
then the Master shall go within; a procession be made; and
Vespers be ended.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There was also a Consecration of Pilgrims, as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Pilgrims first confessed all their sins, after which they
lay prostrate before the Altar. Particular prayers and psalms
were then said over them, and after every psalm (with manifest
skilful appropriation) the <i>Gloria Patri</i>; the Psalm, <i>Ad te, Domine,
levavi</i>; and the <i>Miserere</i>. At the end of these, the
Pilgrims arose from their prostrate position, and the Priest
consecrated their scrips and staves, saying, "The Lord be
with you," and "let us pray," etc. He next sprinkled holy
water upon their scrips and staves, and placed the scrip around
the neck of each pilgrim, with other religious services. Afterwards
he delivered to them the staff with similar prayers. If
any of the Pilgrims were going to Jerusalem, their garments
were in readiness, marked with the cross, and the crosses were
consecrated, and holy water sprinkled over them. The garments
and crosses were then delivered to the Pilgrims, accompanied
by appropriate prayers. The service concluded
with the Mass <i>De Iter Agentibus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Rahere, therefore, among the rest, pilgrimized to
Rome. Now it happened that on the way, either going
or returning, he fell grievously sick and was like
to die. As medical science in those days commanded
but small confidence, men naturally turned to the
saints, and besieged them with petitions for renewed
health. Rahere betook himself to St. Bartholomew,
to whom he promised a hospital for poor men should
he recover. Most fortunately for London, St. Bartholomew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
graciously accepted the proposal, and cured
the pilgrim. Rahere therefore returned: he chose
the site, and was about to build the hospital, when
the saint appeared to him and ordered him to found,
as well, a church. Rahere promised. He even went
beyond his promise: he founded his hospital of St.
Bartholomew, which still exists, a perennial fountain
of life and health, and, besides this, a priory for
canons regular, and a church for the priory. The
church still stands, one of the most noble monuments
in London. One Alfune, who had founded the church
of St. Giles Cripplegate, became the first Hospitaller,
going every day to the shambles to beg for meat for
the sick poor. Rahere became the first prior of his
own foundation, and now lies buried in his church
within a splendid tomb called after his name, but of
fifteenth-century work.</p>

<p>The mysterious part of the story is how Rahere, a
simple gentleman, if not a jester, was able to raise
this splendid structure and to found so noble a hospital.
For, even supposing the hospital and priory to
have been at first small and insignificant, the church
itself remains, a monument of lavish and pious beneficence.
The story, in order to account for the building
of so great a church, goes off into a drivelling account
of how Rahere feigned to be a simple idiot.</p>

<p>A great many people every year visit this noble
church, now partly restored. Very few of them take
the trouble to step round to the back of the church.
Yet there are one or two things worth noting in that
nest of low courts and squalid streets. Cloth Fair,
for instance, still possesses a few of its old timbered
and gabled houses. But on the other side a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
portion of the old monastery church-yard yet remains,
and, in a row of two or three cottages, each with a
tiny garden in front: a cottage-garden close to Smithfield&mdash;survives
a memory of the garden which once
stretched over this monastery court.</p>

<p>Some of the other foundations enumerated were
only recently founded when Fitz Stephen wrote, and
rightly belong to Plantagenet London. But the noble
foundation of the Holy Trinity, Aldgate, was due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
to Matilda, queen of Henry I., who also founded St.
Giles's Hospital, beside St. Giles-in-the-Fields. And
the priory of St. John of Jerusalem, the chief seat in
England of the Knights Hospitallers, was founded in
the year 1100, by
Jordan Briset, and
Muriel, his wife.</p>

<p>St. Katherine's by
the Tower was first
founded by Matilda,
wife of King Stephen.
This, the most
interesting of all the
city foundations, has
survived, in degraded
form, to the present
day. Its appearance
when it was pulled
down, sixty years
ago, and as it is figured,
was very much
unlike the original
foundation by Queen
Matilda. Yet the life
of this old place had
been continuous.
For seven hundred
years it remained on the spot where it was first established.
Matilda first founded St. Katherine's, as a <i>hospitale
pauperum</i>, for the repose of the souls of her two
children who died and were buried in the Holy Trinity
Priory. It was to consist of thirteen members&mdash;"Brothers
and Sisters." It was endowed with certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
estates which the society, after this long lapse of
time, still enjoys; the sisters had the right of voting
at chapter meetings&mdash;a right which they still retain.
The hospital was placed in the charge or custody of
the prior of Holy Trinity. A hundred years later
there was a dispute as to the meaning of the right of
custody, which the priory maintained to be ownership.
In the end Queen Eleanor obtained possession
of the place, and greatly increased its wealth and dignity.
Under her it consisted of a master, three brothers
in orders, three sisters, and ten bedeswomen. They
all lived in their college round the church of St. Katherine.
Queen Philippa, another benefactor, further
endowed the hospital, adding two chaplains and six
poor scholars. Philippa's new charter, with the building
of a splendid church, raised the hospital to a position
far above the small foundation of poor men and
women designed by Matilda. It now stood within
its precinct of eleven acres, possessed of its own
courts, spiritual and temporal, its own law officers,
and even its own prison. Its good-fortune in being
considered the private property of the Queen Consort
caused it to escape the general suppression of the religious
houses. It lived on&mdash;albeit a sleepy life&mdash;a
centre of religion and education to the poor people
among whom it was placed. It should have lived
there till this day; it should have become the Westminster
Abbey of East London; but greed of gain
destroyed it. Its venerable buildings&mdash;its chapel,
college, cloisters, and courts were all destroyed sixty
years ago in order to construct on their site the docks
called St. Katherine's, which were not wanted for the
trade of the City. In order to construct docks, in rivalry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
with other docks already established, this most
precious monument of the past&mdash;the Abbey Church
of East London&mdash;was ruthlessly destroyed. Who
would believe such a thing? The dust and ashes of
the nameless dead which filled its burying-yard were
carried away and used to fill up certain old reservoirs,
on the site of which were built streets and squares;
and in Regent's Park they stuck up a new chapel,
with half a dozen neat houses round it, and called
that St. Katherine's by the Tower. Some day this
foundation, with its income of £10,000 a year, must be
sent back to East London, to which it belongs. Poor
East London! It had one&mdash;only one&mdash;ancient and
venerable foundation, and they have wantonly and
uselessly destroyed it.</p>

<p>Everybody who visits London goes to see the Temple
Church and the courts formerly trodden by the
Templars, now echoing the hurried feet of lawyers
and their clerks. Their beautiful church, however, is
that of the new Temple. There was an older Temple
than this. It stood at the north-east corner of Chancery
Lane. It was certainly some kind of quadrangular
college with its chapel, its hall, its courts, and its
gardens. When the Templars moved to their new
quarters, it passed into other hands and ceased to be
a monastic place. Some of its buildings survived until
the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Is the legend of St. Mary Overies too well-known a
story to be retold? Perhaps there are some readers
who have not read the <i>Chronicles of London Bridge</i>,
where it is narrated.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 276px;"><a name="DOWGATE_DOCK" id="DOWGATE_DOCK"></a>
<img src="images/page_068.jpg" width="276" height="487" alt="DOWGATE DOCK" title="" />
<span class="caption">DOWGATE DOCK</span>
</div>

<p>Long years ago, before there was any London Bridge
at all, a ferry plied across the river between what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
now Dowgate Dock and that now called St. Saviour's
Dock&mdash;both of which exist untouched, save that the
buildings round them are changed. At one time the
ferry-master&mdash;he appears to have sat at home and
taken the money while his servants tugged at the oar&mdash;was
one Awdrey. There was no competition in the
ferry trade of the time, so that this worthy employer
of labor grew rich. As he became old, however, he
fell into the vice common to rich men who are also
old&mdash;that is to say, he became avaricious, covetous,
and miserly; he suffered
acutely from
this failing, in so
much that he grudged
his servants their
very food. This miser
had a daughter,
a lovely damsel
named Mary, of
whom many young
knights became amorous.
To one of
these she lost her
heart; and, as too
commonly happens,
to the poorest, a
thing which her father
could not countenance.
The knight,
therefore, not being
able to get the consent
of Awdrey père,
removed to another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
place, guarding still the memory of his Mary, and
still beloved by her. As there was no post in those
days, and neither could write, they exchanged no letters,
but they preserved their constancy and fidelity.</p>

<p>Now behold what may happen as a punishment for
avarice! The old man one day, devising a way to
save a few meals&mdash;for at a time when death is in the
house who can think upon eating and drinking?&mdash;pretended
that he was dead, and laid himself out with a
white sheet over him. Alas! He was cruelly mistaken.
His servants, learning what had happened, loudly and
openly rejoiced, stripped the larder of all that it contained,
set the casks flowing, opened the bottles, and
began to feast and sing. It was more than the old
man could endure. He sprang from his bed and
rushed among them; they fled, shrieking, because
they thought it was his ghost; one, bolder than the
rest, stood his ground to face the ghost, and banged
the apparition over the head with the butt-end of a
broken oar, so that the unlucky ghost fell down dead
in real earnest. What happened when they came to
bury him may be read in the book above referred to.</p>

<p>The miser's fortune thereupon devolved upon his
daughter. She immediately sent for her lover, who
hastened to obey his mistress. Alas! on his way the
unlucky knight was thrown from his horse and was
killed. The girl, distracted by this misfortune, founded
a convent of sisters at the south end of the ferry,
and taking refuge in her own Foundation, retired from
the world. Here in course of time she died. Later
on, another pious lady changed the convent of sisters
to a college of priests, and very early in the twelfth
century two Norman knights, named Pont de l'Arche<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
and D'Ansey, founded here a great priory, of which
the present Church of St. Saviour was then the chapel.
The Effigy of Pont de l'Arche (or perhaps it is that
of his friend D'Ansey) is still to be seen, with no inscription
upon it, in the church. The chancel, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
two transepts, and the Ladye Chapel now remain of
the old church with its later additions, and at this
moment they are rebuilding the nave in something
like the former style.</p>

<p>"There were in London," Fitz Stephen says, "a
hundred and twenty-six parish churches besides the
cathedral and conventual churches." Whatever the
population may have been, the City has never, in her
most crowded days, when nearly half a million lived
within her walls, wanted more churches. A list of
them may be found in Strype and Stow. Some of
them&mdash;twenty-five, I think&mdash;were never rebuilt after
the great fire. Many of them, in these days, have
been wantonly and wickedly destroyed. Most of the
churches were doubtless small and mean buildings.
Fortunately, we are able to show, by the survival
of one monument, what some of these little parish
churches of London were like in the Saxon and early
Norman times. There remains at Bradford-on-Avon,
a little town of Wiltshire, a church still complete save
for its south porch, built by St. Aldhelm in the eighth
century. There are other partly Saxon and so-called
Saxon remains. There is the most curious church of
Greenstead in Essex, whose walls are trunks of oak-trees.
Perhaps some of the London churches may
have been built in the same way, but it is more probable
that the piety of the parishioners made them of
stone.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The accompanying figure shows the Bradford
church. It is very small; the plan shows the arrangement
of nave, chancel, and north porch; it had a south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
porch, but that is gone. The walls are of thick stone;
the nave is 25 feet 2 inches long, and 13 feet 2 inches
broad; the chancel is 13 feet 2 inches long, and 10
feet broad. The height of the nave to the wall plates
is 25 feet 3 inches; of the chancel is 18 feet. The
chancel opens out from the nave, not with a broad
arch, but with a narrow door only 2 feet 4 inches
broad&mdash;a very curious arrangement. The doors of
the south and north porches are of the same breadth.
The church must have been very dark, but, then, windows
in a cold climate, if you have no glass, must be
as small in size and as few in number as possible. It
was lit by a small window in the eastern wall of the
north porch, no doubt by another in the south porch,
by a small window in the south wall of the nave near
the chancel, and by a fourth small window in the
south wall of the chancel, so placed that the light, and
sometimes the sun, should fall upon the altar during
celebration of mass. The church was thus imperfectly
lit by four small windows, each with its round arch.
The people knelt on the stones; there were no chairs
or benches for them; the bareness of the church at
the present day is just what it was at first. There is
no tower. Over the chancel arch are sculptured two
angels. Outside the church, at the height of about
ten feet, runs a course of round arcades, the only ornament,
unless the remains of some engaged pilasters
on the inner door of the north porch be counted as
ornament. A little new masonry has been added
within, and two new windows have been cut in the
northern wall for the purpose of giving more light.
But with these exceptions the church is exactly as it
was when Aldhelm reared it and dedicated it to St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
Laurence. I do not say that this little church represents
all the Saxon parish churches of London, but
we may be sure that it represents some, and we know
that many of them, even after they had been rebuilt
in the twelfth century, and after mediæval piety had
beautified and decorated them, remained mean and
small. In the matter of Saxon churches we have perhaps
fewer existing specimens than we have of the
earlier British churches. The Church of St. Mary at
Dover, built of Roman bricks and cement; part of St.
Martin's, Canterbury; and the little Cornish Church
of Perranazabuloe belong to that earlier period. But
the Church of St. Laurence, in the pretty old town of
Bradford-on-Avon, is, according to Professor E. A.
Freeman, the one surviving old English church in the
land.</p>

<p>It is impossible to assign a date for the foundation
of these churches, but their dedication in many cases
affords a limit of period before which they could not
have been built. Thus, there are three churches in
London named after St. Olave. This king, canonized
because, with much good feeling, he left off attacking
the English, died at the end of the tenth century.
These churches were therefore erected in or after the
reign of Edward the Confessor. There are two named
after Dunstan, which gives us a limit to their dates.
They were built between the canonization of Dunstan
and the Norman Conquest, because after the conquest
there were no new churches consecrated to Saxon
saints. The dedication of St. Alban's may possibly
mark the site of a church of Roman time, as may also
that of St. Helen's, named after Helena, mother of
Constantine. But I have given reasons for believing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
that everything Roman perished and was forgotten.
The churches of St. Botolph, St. Swithin, St. Osyth,
St. Ethelburga, already mentioned, indicate a Saxon
foundation. St. Alphege was murdered in 1012, so
that his church must have been built between 1012
and 1066. One or two dedications are obscure. Why,
for instance, was a church dedicated to St. Vedast?
He was a bishop of Arras, who, in the sixth century,
confirmed his flock in the faith by a series of miracles
quite novel and startling. But who brought the fame
of Vedast and the history of his miracles to the heart
of London City? Traditionally, the two oldest churches
in London are those of St. Peter, Cornhill, which
claims a Roman origin, and St. Martin's, Ludgate
Hill, which is assigned to a certain British Prince Cadwallo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
Both traditions may be neglected. In the
oldest part of the City, that along the river, the
churches, as I have already mentioned, are mostly
dedicated to the Apostles. Besides the churches, all
the monuments the City had then to show were its
wall, its Great Tower, one or two smaller towers, and
its Bridge.</p>

<p>The original building of the bridge cannot be discovered.
As long as we know anything of London,
the bridge was there. For a long time it was a bridge
of timber, provided with a fortified gate&mdash;one of the
gates of the City. In the year 1091 the Chronicler relates
that on the Feast of St. Edmund, the Archbishop,
at hour of six, a dreadful whirlwind from the south-east,
coming from Africa&mdash;thus do authors in all ages
seize upon the opportunity of parading their knowledge&mdash;"from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
Africa!" all that way!&mdash;blew upon the
City, and overwhelmed upwards of six hundred houses
and several churches, greatly damaged the Tower, and
tore away the roof and part of the wall of St. Mary le
Bow, in Cheapside. During the same storm the water
in the Thames rose with such rapidity and increased
so violently that London Bridge was entirely
swept away.</p>

<p>The bridge was rebuilt. Two years afterwards it
narrowly escaped destruction when a great part of the
City was destroyed by fire. Forty years later it did
meet this fate in the still greater fire of 1135. It was
immediately rebuilt, but I suppose hurriedly, because
thirty years later it had to be constructed anew.</p>

<p>Among the clergy of London was then living one
Peter, chaplain of a small church in the Poultry&mdash;where
Thomas à Becket was baptized&mdash;called Colechurch.
This man was above all others skilled in the
craft and mystery of bridge-building. He was perhaps
a member of the fraternity called the Pontific
(or Bridge-building) Brothers,
who about this time
built the famous bridges at
Avignon, Pont St. Esprit,
Cahors, Saintes, and La
Rochelle. He proposed to
build a stone bridge over
the river. In order to raise
money for this great enterprise, offerings were asked
and contributed by king, citizens, and even the country
at large. The list of contributors was written out on a
table for posterity, and preserved in the Bridge Chapel.</p>

fifty years, took as long to build as King Solomon's
Temple, namely, three-and-thirty years. Before it
was finished the architect lay in his grave. When it
was completed, the
bridge was 926 feet
long, and 40 feet wide&mdash;Stow
says 30 feet;
it stood 60 feet above
high water; it contained
a drawbridge
and 19 pointed arches,
with massive piers,
varying from 25 to 34
feet in solidity, raised
upon strong elm piles,
covered with thick
planks. The bridge
was curiously irregular;
there was no uniformity
in the breadth
of the arches; they
varied from 10 feet
to 32 feet. Over the
tenth and longest pier was erected a chapel, dedicated
to the youngest saint in the calendar, St. Thomas of
Canterbury. The erection of a chapel on a bridge was
by no means uncommon. Everybody, for instance,
who has been in the South of France remembers
the double chapel on the broken bridge at Avignon.
Again, a chapel was built on the bridge at Droitwich,
in Cheshire, and one on the bridge at Wakefield,
in Yorkshire. Like the chapel at Avignon, that
of London Bridge contained an upper and a lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
chapel; the latter was built in the pier with stairs,
making it accessible from the river. The bridge gate
at the southern end was fortified by a double tower,
and there was also a tower at the northern end. The
wall, or parapet of the bridge, followed the line of
the piers, so as to give at every pier additional room.
The same arrangement used to be seen on the old
bridge at Putney. The maintenance of this important
edifice was in the hands of the Brethren of St. Thomas
of the Bridge.</p>

<p>To build a bridge was ever accounted a good work.
Witness the lines engraved on the bridge of Culham:</p>

</div></div>

<p>The citizens have always regarded London Bridge
with peculiar pride and affection. There was no other
bridge like it in the whole country, nor any which
could compare with it for strength or for size. I
think, indeed, that there was not in the whole of
Europe any bridge that could compare with it; for
it was built not only over a broad river, but a tidal
river, up which the flood rose and ebbed with great
vehemence twice a day. Later on they built houses
on either side, but at first the way was clear. The
bridge was endowed with broad lands; certain monks,
called Brethren of St. Thomas on the Bridge, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
charged with the services in the chapel, and with
administering the revenues for the maintenance of
the fabric.</p>

<p>The children made songs about it. One of their
songs to which they danced taking hands has been
preserved. It is modernized, and one knows not how
old it is. The author of <i>Chronicles of London Bridge</i>
gives it at full length, with the music. Here are two
or three verses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>The City wall, repaired by Alfred, was not allowed
to fall into decay again for the next seven hundred
years. A recent discovery proves that the ditch was
more ancient than had been thought. But by the
time of King John it was greatly decayed and stopped
up; in his reign a grand restoration of the ditch
was made by the citizens. Many fragments of the
wall have been discovered dotted along its course,
which is now accurately known, and can be traced.
One of the City churches has a piece of the wall itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
under its north wall. In the church-yard of St.
Alphege there remains a fragment; in the church-yard
of St. Giles there is a bastion. To repair the wall they
seem to have used any materials that offered. Witness
the collection of capitals and pilasters found in a
piece of the City wall, and preserved in the Guildhall.
Witness, also, the story of King John, who, when he
wanted stones for repairing the gates, broke down the
stone-houses of the Jews, robbed their coffers, and used
the stones for his repairs. When Lud Gate was pulled
down some of these stones, with Hebrew inscriptions,
were found, but I believe were all thrown into the
Thames at London Bridge.</p>

<p>The Tower of London, until William Longchamp,
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1190, enclosed it with a wall and a deep ditch,
consisted of nothing but the great White Tower, with
its halls and its chapel of St. John. At the western
end of the wall, where is now Ludgate Hill Railway
Station, stood a smaller tower called Montfichet. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
the opposite bank of the Fleet stood a stronghold,
which afterwards became Bridewell Palace, and covered
the whole site of the broad street which now follows
the approach to Blackfriars Bridge. The site of Tower
Royal is preserved in the street of that name. King
Stephen lodged there. It was afterwards given to
the Crown, and called the Queen's Wardrobe. And
there was another tower in Bucklersbury called Sernes
Tower, of which no trace remains.</p>

<p>Of great houses there were as yet but few&mdash;Blackwell
Hall, if it then stood, would be called Bassing
Hall&mdash;Aldermanbury, the predecessor of Guildhall,
was built by this time; and we hear of certain great
men having houses in the City&mdash;Earl Ferrars in Lombard
Street next to Allhallows and Pont de l'Arche
in Elbow Lane, Dowgate Ward, what time Henry the
First was King.</p>

<p>The water supply of the City until the later years
of the thirteenth century was furnished by the Walbrook,
the Wells or Fleet rivers, and the springs or
fountains outside the walls, of which Stow enumerates
a great many. I suppose that the two streams very
early became choked and fouled and unfit for drinking.
But the conduits and "Bosses" of water were not
commenced till nearly the end of the thirteenth century.
Water-carts carried round fresh water, bringing
it into the town from the springs and wells on the
north. One does not find, however, any period in the
history of London when the citizens desired plain cold
water as a beverage. Beer was always the national
drink; they drank small ale for breakfast, dinner, and
supper; when they could get it they drank strong ale.
Of water for washing there was not at this period so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
great a demand as at present. At the same time it is
not true to say, as was said a few years ago in the
House of Commons, that for eight hundred years our
people did not wash themselves. All through the
Middle Ages the use of the hot bath was not only
common, but frequent, and in the case of the better
classes was almost a necessity of life.</p>

<p>The population of this busy city is tolerably easy
to calculate. The astounding statement of the good
Fitz Stephen that London could turn out an army of
20,000 horse and 60,000 foot, must of course, be dismissed
without argument. Some minds are wholly incapable
of understanding numbers. Perhaps Fitz
Stephen had such a mind. Perhaps in writing the
numerals the numbers got multiplied by ten&mdash;Roman
numerals are hard to manage. If we assume an average
of 400 for each parish church, which, considering
that the church was used daily by the people, seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
not too little, we get a population of about 50,000.
In the time of Richard's poll tax, 300 years later, the
population was about 40,000. But then the City had
been ravaged by a succession of plagues.</p>

<p>The strength of the town and the power of the citizens
is abundantly proved by the chronicles. In the
year 994, Aulaf and Swegen came to fight against London
with ninety-four ships; but "they there sustained
more harm and evil
than they ever imagined
that any townsmen would
be able to do unto them."
Early in the eleventh century
the Londoners beat
off the Danes again and
again. Nor did the citizens
abandon their king
until he abandoned them.
Later on, Edmund Etheling
had to abandon his
enterprise against Cnut,
because the Londoners
would not join him. Then
there is the story about
the body of the murdered Alphege, Archbishop of
Canterbury. This had been deposited in St. Paul's
Cathedral. Agelnoth, successor to Alphege, begged
the body of Cnut for Canterbury. Cnut granted the
request, but was afraid&mdash;<i>timebat civium interruptiones</i>&mdash;to
take away the body except by stealth. He therefore
caused his <i>huscarles</i>, or household soldiers, to
disperse themselves, and to raise tumults at the gates
and elsewhere. While the citizens were running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
everywhere to enjoy a share in the fight, the body
was carried to the river and placed in a boat, which
was rowed in all haste down the river. The townsmen
sent out a party in pursuit. And, as everybody
knows, William the Norman found it politic or necessary
to confirm the liberties and laws of London.</p>

<p>The house, either in Saxon and Norman time, presented
no kind of resemblance to the Roman villa. It
had no cloisters, no hypocaust, no suite or sequence of
rooms. This unlikeness is another proof, if any were
wanting, that the continuity of tenure had been wholly
broken. If the Saxons went into London, as has been
suggested, peaceably, and left the people to carry on
their old life and their trade in their own way, the
Roman and British architecture, no new thing, but a
style grown up in course of years and found fitted to
the climate, would certainly have remained. That,
however, was not the case. The Englishman developed
his house from the patriarchal idea. First, there
was the common hall; in this the household lived,
fed, transacted business, and made their cheer in the
evenings. It was built of timber, and to keep out the
cold draughts it was afterwards lined with tapestry. At
first they used simple cloths, which in great houses
were embroidered and painted; <i>perches</i> of various
kinds were affixed to the walls whereon the weapons,
the musical instruments, the cloaks, etc., were hung
up. The lord and lady sat on a high seat: not, I am
inclined to think, on a dais at the end of the hall,
which would have been cold for them, but on a great
chair near the fire, which was burning in the middle
of the hall. This fashion long continued. I have myself
seen a college hall warmed by a fire in a brazier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
burning under the lantern of the hall. The furniture
consisted of benches; the table was laid on trestles,
spread with a white cloth, and removed after dinner;
the hall was open to all who came, on condition that
the guest should leave his weapons at the door. The
floor was covered with reeds, which made a clean, soft,
and warm carpet, on which the company could, if they
pleased, lie round the fire. They had carpets or rugs
also, but reeds were commonly used. The traveller
who chances to find himself at the ancient and most
interesting town of Kingston-on-Hull, which very few
English people, and still fewer Americans, have
the curiosity to explore, should visit the Trinity
House. There, among many interesting things, he
will find a hall where reeds are still spread, but no
longer so thickly as to form a complete carpet. I
believe this to be the last survival of the reed carpet.
The times of meals were: the breakfast at about
nine; the "noon-meat," or dinner, at twelve; and the
"even-meat," or supper, probably at a movable time,
depending on the length of the day. When lighting
was costly and candles were scarce, the hours of sleep
would be naturally longer in winter than in the summer.
In their manner of living the Saxons were fond
of vegetables, especially of the leek, onion, and garlic.
Beans they also had (these were introduced probably
at the time when they commenced intercourse with
the outer world), pease, radishes, turnips, parsley, mint,
sage, cress, rue, and other herbs. They had nearly all
our modern fruits, though many show by their names,
which are Latin or Norman, a later introduction.
They made use of butter, honey, and cheese. They
drank ale and mead. The latter is still made, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
in small quantities, in Somerset and Hereford shires.
The Normans brought over the custom of drinking
wine.</p>

<span class="caption">PART OF LONDON WALL IN THE CHURCH-YARD OF ST. GILES, CRIPPLEGATE</span>

<p>In the earliest times the whole family slept in the
common hall. The first improvement was the erection
of the solar, or upper, chamber. This was above the
hall, or a portion of it, or over the kitchen and buttery
attached to the hall. The arrangement may be still
observed in many of the old colleges of Oxford or
Cambridge. The solar was first the sleeping-room of
the lord and lady: though afterwards it served not
only this purpose, but also for an ante-chamber to
the dormitory of the daughters and the maid-servants.
The men of the household still slept in the
hall below. Later on, bed recesses were contrived in
the wall, as one may find in Northumberland at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
present day. The bed was commonly, but not for the
ladies of the house, merely a big bag stuffed with
straw. A sheet wrapped round the body formed the
only night-dress. But there were also pillows, blankets,
and coverlets. The early English bed was quite
as luxurious as any that followed after, until the invention
of the spring-mattress gave a new and hitherto
unhoped-for joy to the hours of night.</p>

<p>The second step in advance was the ladies' bower,
a room or suite of rooms set apart for the ladies of
the house and their women. For the first time, as soon
as this room was added, the women could follow their
own avocations of embroidery, spinning, and needle-work
of all kinds apart from the rough and noisy talk
of the men.</p>

<p>The main features, therefore, of every great house,
whether in town or country, from the seventh to the
twelfth century, were the hall, the solar, built over
the kitchen and buttery, and the ladies' bower.</p>

<p>There was also the garden. In all times the English
have been fond of gardens. Bacon thought it
not beneath his dignity to order the arrangement of a
garden. Long before Bacon, a writer of the twelfth
century describes a garden as it should be. "It should
be adorned on this side with roses, lilies, and the marigold;
on that side with parsley, cost, fennel, southernwood,
coriander, sage, savery, hyssop, mint, vine, dettany,
pellitory, lettuce, cresses, and the peony. Let
there be beds enriched with onions, leeks, garlic, mellons,
and scallions. The garden is also enriched by
the cucumber, the soporiferous poppy, and the daffodil,
and the acanthus. Nor let pot herbs be wanting,
as beet-root, sorrel, and mallow. It is useful also to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
the gardener to have anice, mustard, and wormwood....
A noble garden will give you medlars, quinces,
the pear main, peaches, pears of St. Regle, pomegranates,
citrons, oranges, almonds, dates, and figs." The
latter fruits were perhaps attempted, but no one
doubts their arriving at ripeness. Perhaps the writer
sets down what he hoped would be some day achieved.</p>

<p>The in-door amusements of the time were very much
like our own. We have a little music in the evening;
so did our forefathers; we sometimes have a little
dancing; so did they, but the dancing was done for
them; we go to the
theatres to see the
mime; in their days
the mime made his
theatre in the great
man's hall. He played
the fiddle and the
harp; he sang songs;
he brought his daughter,
who walked on her
hands and executed astonishing capers; the gleeman,
minstrels, or jongleur was already as disreputable as
when we find him later on with his <i>ribauderie</i>. Again,
we play chess; so did our ancestors; we gamble with
dice; so did they; we feast and drink together; so did
they; we pass the time in talk; so did they. In a
word, as Alphonse Karr put it, the more we change,
the more we remain the same.</p>

<p>Out-of-doors, as Fitz Stephen shows, the young men
skated, wrestled, played ball, practised archery, held
water tournaments, baited bull and bear, fought cocks,
and rode races. They were also mustered sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
for service in the field, and went forth cheerfully, being
specially upheld by the reassuring consciousness
that London was always on the winning side.</p>

<p>The growth of the city government belongs to the
history of London. Suffice it here to say that the
people in all times enjoyed a freedom far above that
possessed by any other city of
Europe. The history of municipal
London is a history of
continual struggle to maintain
this freedom against all attacks,
and to extend it and to make
it impregnable. Already the
people are proud, turbulent,
and confident in their own
strength. They refuse to own
any over lord but the King
himself; there is no Earl of
London. They freely hold
their free and open meetings&mdash;their
Folk's mote&mdash;in the open
space outside the north-west
corner of St. Paul's Church-yard.
That they lived roughly,
enduring cold, sleeping in small
houses in narrow courts; that
they suffered much from the
long darkness of winter; that
they were always in danger of
fevers, agues, "putrid" throats,
plagues, fires by night, and civil
wars; that they were ignorant
of letters&mdash;three schools only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
for the whole of London&mdash;all this may very well be
understood. But these things do not make men and
women wretched. They were not always suffering
from preventable disease; they were not always hauling
their goods out of the flames; they were not always
fighting. The first and most simple elements
of human happiness are three, to wit: that a man
should be in bodily health, that he should be free,
that he should enjoy the produce of his own labor.
All these things the Londoner possessed under the
Norman kings nearly as much as in these days they
can be possessed. His city has always been one of
the healthiest in the world. Whatever freedom could
be attained he enjoyed, and in that rich trading town
all men who worked lived in plenty.</p>

<p>The households, the way of living, the occupations
of the women, can be clearly made out in every detail
from the Anglo-Saxon literature. The women in the
country made the garments, carded the wool, sheared
the sheep, washed the things, beat the flax, ground
the corn, sat at the spinning-wheel, and prepared the
food. In the towns they had no shearing to do, but
all the rest of their duty fell to their province. The
English women excelled in embroidery. "English"
work meant the best kind of work. They worked
church vestments with gold and pearls and precious
stones. "Orfrey," or embroidery in gold, was a special
art. Of course they are accused by the ecclesiastics of
an overweening desire to wear finery; they certainly
curled their hair, and, one is sorry to read, they painted,
and thereby spoiled their pretty cheeks. If the man
was the hlaf-ord&mdash;the owner or winner of the loaf&mdash;the
wife was the hlaf-dig, its distributor; the servants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
and the retainers were hlaf-oetas, or eaters of it.
When nunneries began to be founded, the Saxon
ladies in great numbers forsook the world for the cloister.
And here they began to learn Latin, and became
able at least to carry on correspondence&mdash;specimens
of which still exist&mdash;in that language. Every
nunnery possessed a school for girls. They were
taught to read and to write their own language and
Latin, perhaps also rhetoric and embroidery. As the
pious Sisters were fond of putting on violet chemises,
tunics, and vests of delicate tissue, embroidered with
silver and gold, and scarlet shoes, there was probably
not much mortification of the flesh in the nunneries
of the later Saxon times.</p>

<p>This for the better class. We cannot suppose that
the daughters of the craftsmen became scholars of the
Nunnery. Theirs were the lower walks&mdash;to spin the
linen and to make the bread and carry on the house-work.</p>

<hr style='margin-left:27.5%; width:45%'/>

<p>Let us walk into the narrow streets and see something
more closely of the townfolk. We will take the
close net-work of streets south of Paul's and the Cheapside,
where the lanes slope down to the river. North
of Chepe there are broad open spaces never yet built
upon; south, every inch of ground is valuable. The
narrow winding lanes are lined with houses on either
side; they are for the most part houses with wooden
fronts and roofs of timber. Here and there is a stone
house; here and there the great house of a noble, or
of a City baron, or a great merchant, as greatness is
counted. But as yet the trade of London goes not
farther than Antwerp, or Sluys, or Bordeaux at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
farthest. Some of the houses stand in gardens, but
in this part, where the population is densest, most of
the gardens have become courts; and in the courts
where the poorest live, those who are the porters and
carriers, and lightermen and watermen&mdash;the servants
of the Port&mdash;the houses are huts, not much better
than those whose ruins may still be seen on Dartmoor;
of four uprights, with wattle and clay for walls,
and a thatched roof, and a fire burning on the floor in
the middle. At the corners of the streets are laystalls,
where everything is flung to rot and putrefy; the
streets are like our country lanes, narrow and muddy;
public opinion is against shooting rubbish into the
street, but it is done; the people walk gingerly among
the heaps of offal and refuse. In the wooden houses,
standing with shutters and doors wide open all the
year round, sit the men at work, each in his own trade,
working for his own master; every man belongs to his
guild, which is as yet religious. Here is a church, the
Church of St. George, Botolph Lane; the doors are
open; the bells are ringing; the people are crowding
in. Let us enter. It is a Mystery that they are going
to play&mdash;nothing less than the Raising of Lazarus according
to Holy Scripture. The church within is dark
and gloomy, but there is light enough to see the platform,
or low stage, under the nave covered with red
cloth, which has been erected for the Play. The
actors are young priests and choristers. All round
the stage stand the people, the men in leather jerkins&mdash;they
do not remove their caps&mdash;the women in woollen
frocks, the children with eyes wide open. When
the Play begins they all weep without restraint at the
moving passages. In the first scene Lazarus lies on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
his bed, at the point of death&mdash;weak, faint, speechless.
He is attended by his friends&mdash;four Jews, attired in
realistic fashion, no mistake about their nationality&mdash;infidels,
mécréants&mdash;and by his sisters twain, marvellously
like two nuns of the period. They send a messenger
to the new Great Physician and Worker of
Miracles, who is reported to be preaching and healing
not far off. But He delays; Lazarus dies. His sister
goes to reproach the Physician with the delay, wailing
and lamenting her brother's death. At length He
comes. Lazarus is already buried. The tomb is on
the stage, with the dead man inside. Jesus calls. Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
miracle! we saw him die; we saw him buried. Lo!
he rises and comes forth from the grave. To the
people it is as if the Lord Jesus himself stood before
them; they have seen Him with their own eyes;
henceforth the name of the Lord recalls a familiar
form; experienced persons of dull imagination say
that this is not Jesus at all, but Stephen the Deacon&mdash;he
with the heavenly voice and the golden locks. No,
no; it is not Stephen they have seen, but Another.
So, also, some will have it that the man who died and
was buried, and rose again, and stood before them all
in white cerements, was John of Hoggesdon, Chantry
Priest. Not so; it was Lazarus&mdash;none other. Lazarus,
now no doubt a blessed saint, with his two sisters,
Martha and Mary. Why! it must have been Lazarus,
because, after the miracle, he called upon the people
to mark the wondrous works of the Lord, and sang
the Magnificat so that the psalm echoed in the roof and
rolled above the pillars. He sang that psalm out of
pure gratitude; you could see the tears rolling down
his cheeks; and in worship and adoration, Lazarus himself,
he who had been dead and had come to life again.</p>

<p>The Mystery is over; the people have all gone
away; the stage is removed, and the church is empty
again. Two priests are left, and their talk is like a
jarring note after sweet music. "Brother," says one,
"were it not for such shows as these, if we did not
present to the people the things which belong to religion
in such a way that the dullest can understand,
the Church would be in a parlous way. All folk cry
out upon the profligacy of the monks, and their
luxury, and the greed of the priests. What sayeth

<p>It is an evening in May. What means this procession?
Here comes a sturdy rogue marching along
valiantly, blowing pipe and beating tabor. After him,
a rabble rout of lads and young men, wearing flowers
in their caps, and bearing branches and singing lustily.
This is what they sing, not quite in these words,
but very nearly:</p>

<p>The workman jumps up and shouts as they go
past; the priest and the friar laugh and shout; the
girls, gathering together as is the maidens' way, laugh
and clap their hands. The young men sing as they
go and dance as they sing. Spring has come back
again&mdash;sing cuckoo; the days of light and warmth&mdash;sing
cuckoo; the time of feasting and of love&mdash;sing
cuckoo. The proud abbot, with his following, draws
rein to let them pass, and laughs to see them; he is,
you see, a man first and a monk afterwards. In the
gateway of his great house stands the Norman earl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
with his livery. He waits to let the London youth
go by. The earl scorns the English youth no longer;
he knows their lustihood. He can even understand
their speech. He sends out largesse to the lads to
be spent in the good wines of Gascony and of Spain;
he joins in the singing; he waves his hand, a brotherly
hand, as the floral greenery passes along; he sings
with them at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>Presently the evening falls. It is light till past eight;
the days are long. At nightfall, in summer, the people
go to bed. In the great houses they assemble in
the hall; in winter they would listen to music and
the telling of stories, even the legends of King Arthur.
Walter Map<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> will collect them and arrange them,
and the French romances, such as "Amis et Amils,"
"Aucassin et Nicolette," though these have not yet
been written down. In summer they have music before
they go to bed. We are in a city that has always
been fond of music. The noise of crowd and pipe,
tabor and cithern, is now silent in the streets. Rich
men kept their own musicians. What said Bishop Grossetête?</p>

<p>He who looks and listens for the voice of the people
in these ancient times hears no more than a confused
murmur: one sees a swarm working like ants;
a bell rings: they knock off work; another bell: they
run together; they shout; they wave their hats; the
listener, however, hears no words. It is difficult in any
age&mdash;even in the present day&mdash;to learn or understand
what the <i>bas peuple</i> think and what they desire. They
want few things indeed in every generation; only, as I
said above, the three elements of freedom, health, and
just pay. Give them these three and they will grumble
no longer. When a poet puts one of them on his
stage and makes him act and makes him speak, we
learn the multitude from the type. Later on, after
Chaucer and Piers Ploughman have spoken, we know
the people better; as yet we guess at them, we do
not even know them in part. Observe, however, one
thing about London&mdash;a thing of great significance.
When there is a Jacquerie, when the people, who
have hitherto been as silent as the patient ox, rise
with a wild roar of rage, <i>it is not in London</i>. Here
men have learned&mdash;however imperfectly&mdash;the lesson
that only by combination of all for the general welfare
is the common weal advanced. I think, also,
that London men, even those on the lowest levels,
have always known very well that their humility of
place is due to their own lack of purpose and self-restraint.
The air of London has always been charged
with the traditions and histories of those who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
raised themselves; there never has been a city more
generous to her children, more ready to hold out a
helping hand; this we shall see illustrated later on; at
present all is beginning. The elementary three conditions
are felt, but not yet put into words.</p>

<p>We are at present in the boyhood of a city which
after a thousand years is still in its strong and vigorous
manhood, showing no sign, not the least sign, of
senility or decay. Rather does it appear like a city
in its first spring of eager youth. But the real work
for Saxon and Norman London lies before. It is
to come. It is a work which is to be the making of
Great Britain and of America, Australia, and the Isles.
It is the work of building up, defending, and consolidating
the liberties of the Anglo-Saxon race.</p>

<p>They were not wretched at all, these early London
citizens; but, on the contrary, joyous and happy and
hopeful. And not only for the reasons already stated,
but for the great fact&mdash;the greatest fact of the time&mdash;of
their blind and unreasoning faith. It is impossible
to exaggerate the importance of unreasoning
faith as a factor in human happiness. The life of the
meanest man was full of dignity and of splendor, because
of the great inheritance assured to him by the
Church. We must never leave out the Church in
speaking of the past. We must never forget that all
people, save here and there a doubting Rufus or a questioning
Prince of Anjou, believed without the shadow
of any doubt. Knowledge brought the power of questioning.
As yet there was no knowledge. Therefore
every man's life, however miserable, was, to his
happy ignorance, the certain ante-room of heaven.
We are fond of dwelling on the mediæval hell, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
stupidity and the brutality of its endless torture, and
the selfishness of buying salvation by masses. Hell,
my friends, was always meant for the other man. He
who saw the devils painted on the church-wall, rending,
tearing, frying, cutting, burning the poor souls
in hell, knew these souls for those of his enemies.
Like Dante, he saw among them all his public and
his private foes. He looked upward for his hope.
There he beheld loving angels bearing aloft in their
soft arms the soul redeemed to the abode of perfect
bliss. In that soul he recognized himself; he saw the
portraiture, exact and lifelike, of his own features.</p>

<p>When the ambassadors of the Caliph Haroun al
Raschid brought gifts to the great King Karl, the
finest thing he had to show them was the splendid
service of the Church.</p>

<p>This story is told literally. It might be told as an
allegory. In London Saxon and Norman, as also for
many centuries to follow, the finest thing they had to
show was the Church, with its music that moved the
heart to tears; its promises, which steeled the soul to
endurance; its glories, which carried the beholder far
away from the wattle and clay of his hut and his
grimy leathern doublet; its frown, which stood between
him and the tyrannous Over Lord, and saved
his home from starvation and his womankind from
dishonor. Fortunate was it for the people that they
had the Church to show to those ambassadors of the
Moslem.</p>

<p>Prince Pantagruel and his companions,
pursuing their incomparable voyage, sailed three
days and three nights without discovering anything,
and on the fourth day made land. The Pilot told
them that it was the Ringing Island; and, indeed, they
heard afar off a kind of a confused and oft-repeated
noise, that seemed at a distance not unlike the sound
of great, middle-sized, and little bells rung all at once.</p>

<p>Commentators have been much exercised as to the
city which the great Master of Allegory had in view
when he described <i>l'Ile Sonnante</i>. Foolish commentators!
As if even a small master of allegory, much
less the great and illustrious Alcofribas Nasier, could,
or would, mean any one town in particular! One
might as well search for the man whose portrait he
painted and called Panurge. He described all towns.
For, in truth, every mediæval city was an <i>Ile Sonnante</i>,
and the greater, the richer, the more populous, the
more powerful was the city, the louder and the more
frequent were the jinglings and the janglings, the sonorous
clang and the melodious peal, the chimings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
and the strikings, the music and the jarring of the
thousand Bells. They rang all day long; they rang
from the great Cathedral and from the little Parish
Church; from the stately monastery, the nunnery, the
College of Priests, the Spital, the Chantry, the Chapel,
and the Hermitage. They rang for Festivals, for Fasts,
for Pageants, for Processions, for Births, Marriages,
and Funerals; for the election of city officers, for
Coronations, for Victories, and for daily service; they
rang to mark the day and the hour; they rang in the
baby; they rang out the passing soul; they rang for
the bride; they rang in memory of the dead; they
rang for work to begin and for work to cease; they
rang to exhort, to admonish, to console.</p>

<p>With their ringing the City was never quiet. Four
miles out of London, the sound of the Bells rang in
the ears of the downcast 'prentice boy who sat upon
the green slopes of Highgate: the chimes of Bow
struck merrily upon his ear above the tinkling of the
sheep bell, the carol of the lark, and the song of the
thrush. To him they brought a promise and a hope.
What they brought to the busy folk in the streets I
know not; but since they were a folk of robust nerves,
the musical, rolling, melodious, clashing, joyous ringing
of bells certainly brought for the most part a
sense of elation, hope, and companionship. So, in
this our later day, the multitudinous tripper or the
Hallelujah lad is not happy unless he can make, as he
goes, music&mdash;loud music&mdash;in the train and on the
sands. So, again, those who march in procession do
not feel complete without a braying band with drums
great and small, banging and beating and roaring an
accompaniment to the mottoes on their banners, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
uplifting the souls of the champions who are about to
harangue the multitude.</p>

<p>The <i>Ile Sonnante</i> of Rabelais may have been Paris&mdash;of
course it was Paris; it may have been Avignon&mdash;there
is not the least doubt that it was Avignon; it
may also have been London&mdash;there can be no manner
of question on that point. Rabelais never saw London;
but so loud was the jingle-jangle of the City
bells that they smote upon his ear while he was beginning
that unfinished book of his and inspired the
first chapters. London, without a
doubt, London, and no other, is the
true <i>Ile Sonnante</i>.</p>

<p>Of Plantagenet London there is
much to be said and written. <i>Place
à l'Église!</i> It was a time when
the Church covered all. Faith unquestioning
seemed to have produced
its full effect. The promised
Kingdom, according to eyes ecclesiastic,
was already among us. What
could be better for the world than
that it should be ruled absolutely
by the Vicar of Christ? Yet the
full effect of this rule proved in the event not quite
what might have been expected.</p>

<p>In London, says an observant Frenchman, there is
no street without a church and a tree. He speaks of
modern London. Of London in the thirteenth century,
there was no street without its monastery, its
convent garden, its College of Priests, its Canons regular,
its Friars, its Pardoners, its sextons, and its serving
brothers, and this without counting its hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
twenty parish churches, each with its priests, its chantries,
its fraternities, and its church-yard. The Church
was everywhere; it played not only an important part
in the daily life, but the most important part. Not
even the most rigid Puritan demanded of the world so
much of its daily life and so great a share of its revenues
as the Church of the Middle Ages. There were
already whispered and murmured questions, but the
day of revolt was still two hundred long years ahead.
Meantime the Church reigned and ruled, and no man
yet dared disobey.</p>

<p>Let us consider, therefore, as the most conspicuous
feature of Plantagenet London, her great religious
Houses. We have seen what they were in Norman
London. Already there were there in existence the
Cathedral of St. Paul's, with its canons and priests, its
army of singing men, clerks, boys, and servants&mdash;itself
a vast monastic House; the Priory of St. Bartholomew;
the House of St. Mary Overies; the Hospital
of St. Katherine; the Priory of the Holy Trinity. After
three hundred years, when we look again upon the map
of London, and mark in color the sites of Monastery,
Nunnery, Church, College, and Church-yard, it seems
as if a good fourth part of the City area was swallowed
up in ecclesiastical Houses. Not so much was actually
covered by buildings of the Church, but at least a
fourth of the City, counting the gardens and the
courts and chapels, belonged to the Church and the
religious Houses. Without such a map it is impossible
to estimate the enormous wealth of the mediæval
Church, its power, and its authority. It is impossible
to understand without such a map how enormous was
that Revolution which could shake off and shatter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
into fragments a power so tremendous. Because, as
was London, so was every other city. If London had
a hundred and twenty churches, Norwich had sixty;
York had forty-five. If the country all round London
was parcelled out among the religious Houses, so all
over the land, manors here, and estates there, broad
acres everywhere belonged to the monks. But though
their property was enormous, their power was far beyond
that conferred by any amount of property, for
they held the keys of heaven and kept open the gates
of hell.</p>

<p>As for the vast numbers actually maintained by the
Church, the single example of St. Paul's Cathedral&mdash;of
course, the largest foundation in the City&mdash;will furnish
an illustration. In the year 1450 the Society, a
Cathedral body, included the following: the Bishop,
the Dean, the four Archdeacons, the Treasurer, the Precentor,
the Chancellor, thirty greater Canons, twelve
lesser Canons, about fifty Chaplains or chantry priests,
and thirty Vicars. Of inferior rank to these were the
Sacrist and three Vergers, the Succentor, the Master of
the Singing-school, the Master of the Grammar-school,
the Almoner and his four Vergers, the Servitors, the
Surveyor, the twelve Scribes, the Book Transcriber, the
Book-binder, the Chamberlain, the Rent-collector, the
Baker, the Brewer, the singing-men and choir-boys, of
whom priests were made, the Bedesmen, and the poor
folk. In addition to these must be added the servants
of all these officers&mdash;the brewer, who brewed in
the year 1286, 67,814 gallons, must have employed a
good many; the baker, who ovened every year 40,000
loaves, or every day more than a hundred, large and
small; the sextons, grave-diggers, gardeners, bell-ringers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
makers and menders of the ecclesiastical robes,
cleaners and sweepers, carpenters, masons, painters,
carvers and gilders&mdash;one can very well understand that
the Church of St. Paul's alone found a livelihood for
thousands.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 479px;"><a name="RUINS_1790_OF_THE_NUNNERY_OF_ST_HELEN_BISHOPSGATE_STREET" id="RUINS_1790_OF_THE_NUNNERY_OF_ST_HELEN_BISHOPSGATE_STREET"></a>

<span class="caption">RUINS (1790) OF THE NUNNERY OF ST. HELEN, BISHOPSGATE STREET</span>
</div>

<p>The same equipment was necessary in every other
religious foundation. Not a monastery but had its
great and lesser officers and their servants. In every
one there were the bell-ringers, the singing-men and
boys, the vergers, the gardeners, the brewers, bakers,
cooks, messengers, scribes, rent-collectors, and all complete
as was St. Paul's, though on a smaller scale. It
does not seem too much to estimate the ecclesiastical
establishments as including a fourth part of the whole
population of the City.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span></p>

<p>The London monasteries lay for the most part
either just within or just without the City Wall. The
reason is obvious. They were founded when the City
was already populous, and were therefore built upon
the places where houses were less numerous and
ground was of less value.</p>

<p>Let us, in order to visit them all, make a circuit
within the City Wall, beginning from the Tower on the
East.</p>

<p>The first House at which we stop is the Priory of
Crutched Friars, that is, Crossed Friars. They wore
a cross of red cloth upon their backs, and carried an
iron cross in their hands. The order of the Red
Cross was founded by one Conrad, of Bologna, in the
year 1169. Some of the Friars found their way to
London in the middle of the next century, and humbly
begged of the pious folk a house to live in. Of
course they got it, and many houses afterwards, with a
good following of the citizens. This monastery stood
behind Seething Lane, opposite St. Olave's Church.
The site afterwards became that of the Navy House,
and is still marked by the old stone pillars of the
entrance and the open court within. This court is
now a receiving house for some railway. Beyond
this, on the other side of Aldgate, stood a far more
important monastery, that of the Holy Trinity. The
site of the place is marked&mdash;for there is not a vestige
left of the ancient buildings&mdash;by a mean little square
now called St. James's Square; a place of resort for
the poorer Jews. This noble House was founded by
Matilda, wife of Henry I., in 1109, for regular Canons
of the Order of St. Augustine. The Priory, enriched
by many later benefactors, became the wealthiest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
most splendid in the City. Its Prior, by virtue of his
office, and because the old Knighten Guild had given
their property to the Priory, was Alderman of Portsoken
ward; the monastery was exempted from ecclesiastical
jurisdiction other than the Pope's; its church
was great and magnificent, full of stately monuments,
carved marbles, and rich shrines; the House was hospitable
and nobly charitable to the poor.</p>

<p>The beautiful old church of St. Helen, filled with
monuments curious and quaint, was formerly the
Church of the Priory of St. Helen. This nunnery was
founded by William Basing, dean of St. Paul's, in the
reign of Richard I. The church, as it now stands,
consists of the old Parish Church and the Nun's
Chapel, formerly separated by a partition wall. The
Leathersellers' Company acquired some of their ground
after the Dissolution, and the old Hall of the Nunnery,
afterwards the Leathersellers' Hall, was standing until
the year 1799.</p>

<p>On the north of Broad Street stood the splendid
House of Austin Friars; that is, the Friars Eremites
of the Order of St. Augustine. The House was founded
by Humphrey Bohun, Earl of Hereford, in the
year 1253. It rapidly became one of the wealthiest
Houses in the City; its church, very splendid, was filled
with monuments. Part of it stands to this day. It is
now used by the Dutch residents in London. The
quiet courts and the square at the back of the church
retain something of the former monastic arrangement
and of the old tranquillity. The square is certainly
one of the courts of the monastery, but I know not
whether the Refectory or the Library or the Abbot's
House stood here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span></p>

<p>The next great House following the wall westward
was that of St. Martin's le Grand, of which I have already
spoken. It was a House of Augustine Canons.
It formed a Precinct with its own Liberty. William of
Wykeham was its most famous Dean. In the sanctuary
Miles Forrest, one of the murderers of the two
Princes in the Tower, died&mdash;"rotted away piecemeal."
The Liberty survived long after the Dissolution.</p>

<p>Adjoining St. Martin's was the great Foundation of
the Grey Friars.</p>

<p>They were Franciscans. Who does not know the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
story of St. Francis and the foundation of his great
order? They were the Preachers of the poor. The
first Franciscans, like the Buddhist priests, lived upon
alms; they had no money, no endowments, no books,
no learning, no great houses. Those who came to
England&mdash;it was in the year 1224&mdash;nine in number, of
whom only one was a priest, were penniless. They
first halted in Canterbury, where they were permitted
to sleep at night in a room used by day as a school.
Four of them presently moved on to London, where
they hired a piece of ground on Cornhill, and built upon
it rude cells of wattle and clay with their own hands.
Already the Dominicans, their rivals&mdash;Preachers of
the learned and the rich&mdash;had obtained a settlement
in Oxford. The Franciscans stayed a very short time
on Cornhill. In the year 1225 one John Ewin bought
and presented to them a piece of ground north of
Newgate Street, whither they removed. Their austerity,
their poverty, their earnestness, their eloquence
drew all hearts towards them. And, as always
happens, their very popularity proved their ruin.
Kings and queens, great lords and ladies, strove and
vied with each other to show their love and admiration
for the men who had given up all that the world can
offer for the sake of Christ and for pity of their brothers
and sisters. They showed this love in the manner
common with the world. They forced upon the friars
a portion of their wealth; they made them receive
and enjoy the very things they had renounced. It is
a wonderful record. First, the citizens began. One
Lord Mayor built a new choir for their church, with a
splendor worthy of the order and of the City; another
built the nave to equal the choir; a third built the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
dormitories&mdash;no more wattle and daub for the dear
friars; other citizens built Chapter House, Vestry
House, Infirmary, and Refectory. Their Library was
given by Dick Whittington, thrice Mayor of London.
Then came the turn of the great people. Queen Margaret
thought the choir of the church should be still
more splendid, and added to it or rebuilt it. Queen
Isabel and Queen Philippa thought that the nave
should be more splendid, and with the help of the Earl
and Countess of Richmond, the Earl of Gloucester and
his sisters, Lord Lisle and others, built a new nave,
300 feet long, 89 feet broad, and 64 feet high. Here
were buried, as in ground far more sacred than that
of St. Paul's or any acre of ordinary consecration,
Margaret, wife of Edward I.; Isabel, wife of Edward
II.; Joan of the Tower, Queen of Scots, daughter of
Edward II.; Isabel, daughter of Edward III.; Beatrice,
daughter of Henry III.; and an extraordinary number
of persons great and honorable in their day. What
became of their monuments and of the church itself
belongs to Tudor London.</p>

<p>All those who visit London are recommended by
the guide-books to see the famous Blue-coat School.
The main entrance is at the end of a narrow lane leading
north from Newgate Street. On the right hand
of the lane stands a great ugly pile built by Wren
twenty years after the Great Fire. This is Christ
Church, and it stands on part of the site of the old
church of the Grey Friars. At the Dissolution, Henry
VIII. made their church into a parish church, assigning
to it the two parishes of St. Nicolas Shambles
and St. Ewin, together with the ground occupied by
the Monastery. The church within is as ugly as it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
without. One shudders to think of the change from
the great and splendid monastic church. On the
other side of the lane is an open space, a church-yard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
now disused. The old church covered both this open
space and the area of the modern church. Behind it
stood the cloisters, the burial-ground, and the monastic
buildings of the House, covering a great extent
of ground. Those who go through the gate find themselves
in a large quadrangle asphalted. This is now
part of the boys' play-ground; their feet run every day
over the old tombs and graves of the Grey Friars' burial-ground;
the soil, though not accounted so sacred
as that within the church itself, was considered greatly
superior to that of any common church-yard. Most of
the dead were buried in the habit of the Grey Friars,
as if to cheat Peter into a belief of their sanctity. On
the south of the quadrangle two or three arches may
be observed. These are the only fragments remaining
of the cloisters. The view of Christ's Hospital after
the Great Fire of 1666 shows the old courts of the
Abbey. The church formerly extended over the
whole front of the picture; the buildings now seen are
wholly modern; the cloistered square was the church-yard;
the Hall stood across the north side of the first
court; beyond were the courts appropriated to the
service of the monks; the cells, libraries, etc., were
round the great court and the small courts on the
right. The Franciscan House is gone; the Friars are
gone. Let us not think, however, that their work is
gone. On the contrary, all that was good in it remains.
That is the quality and the test of good work.
It is imperishable. If you ask what is this work
and where it may be found, look about you. In the
prosperity of the City; in the energy, the industry,
the courage, the soberness of its people; in whatever
virtues they possess, the Franciscans have their share;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
the Grey Friars, who went straight at the people&mdash;the
rough, common, ignorant people&mdash;and saved them
from the destruction of those virtues which built up
this realm of Britain. The old ideas change; what is
to-day faith becomes to-morrow superstition; but the
new order is built upon the old. It was a part of the
training necessary for the English people that they
should pass under the teaching of the Friars.</p>

<p>In the south-western corner of the City Wall were
lodged the Dominicans or Black Friars.</p>

<p>These, the Preaching Friars, came to England two
years before their rivals, the Franciscans. Their first
settlement was in the country lane which now we call
Chancery Lane. After a residence there of fifty years
they removed to this corner of the town, which was,
so to speak, made for them&mdash;that is, the City Wall
which formerly ran straight from Ludgate to the river
was pulled down and rebuilt farther west along the
bank of the Fleet. Within the piece of ground thus
added the Black Friars settled down, and because the
ground had not formerly belonged to the City, it now
became a Precinct of its own, enclosed by its own
wall, with its four gates not amenable to the City and
pretending to a right of Sanctuary. Edward I. and
his Queen Eleanor were great benefactors to the Dominicans.
Of the church and the stately buildings of
the proud order not a trace remains. In the Guildhall
Museum may be seen a drawing of some ruined
vaults belonging to the Abbey, which were discovered
on enlarging the premises of the <i>Times</i> some years
ago. There is nothing above-ground. The Dominicans,
however, never succeeded in winning the affections
of the people to the same extent as the Franciscans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
They were learned; they insisted strongly
on doctrine; but they were harder of heart than the
Grey Friars. It was the Dominicans who encouraged
the planting of the Inquisition.</p>

<p>All these Houses were within the walls. Without
were others, as rich and as splendid. South of Fleet
Street, between Bridewell Palace and the Temple, was
the House of the Carmelites, called the White Friars.
These also were an Order of Mendicants. The <i>Fratres
Beatæ Mariæ de Monte Carmelo</i> sprang from the hermits
who settled in numbers on the slopes of Mount
Carmel. They were formed into an order by Almeric,
Bishop of Antioch, and were first introduced into
Europe about the year 1216, by Albert, Patriarch of
Jerusalem. They got their house in London from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
Edward I.; but their chief benefactor was Hugh Courtenay,
Earl of Devonshire. They, too, had their Sanctuary,
afterwards called Alsatia. This privilege was
not abolished till the year 1697.</p>

<p>Beyond the Carmelites were the Templars, but the
suppression of the Order removed them from the
scene in the year 1310.</p>

<p>The Priories of St. Bartholomew and of St. John
belong to Norman London. On the north of Bartholomew's,
however, stood the house of the Carthusians.
The Carthusian Order was a branch of the
Benedictine Rule, to which the Cluniacs and Cistercians
also belonged.</p>

<p>The house of the Salutation of the Mother of God&mdash;which
was its full title&mdash;was founded in the year
1371 by Sir Walter Manny. Those who know their
Froissart know that gallant Knight well and can testify
to his achievements; how he entreated King Edward
for the citizens of Calais; how he rescued the Countess
of Montfort besieged in the castle of Hennebont,
and, for his reward, was kissed&mdash;he and his companions&mdash;not
once, but two or three times, by that brave
lady; these and many other things can be told of this
noble Knight. Not the least of his feats was the
foundation of this House of Religion.</p>

<p>When we speak of the Plague of London we generally
mean that of 1664-65. But this was only the
last, and perhaps not the worst, of the many plagues
which had visited the City. Thirteen great pestilences
fell upon the City between the years 1094 and 1625&mdash;in
the last year 35,000 died. That is to say, one plague
happened about every forty years, so that there never
was a time when a recent plague was not in the minds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
of men. Always they remembered the last visitation,
the suddenness and swiftness of destruction, the desolation
of houses, the striking down of young and old,
the loss of the tender children, the sweet maidens,
the gallant youth. Life is brief and uncertain at
the best; but when the plague is added to the diseases
which men expect, its uncertainty is forced
upon the minds of the people of every condition with
a persistence and a conviction unknown in quiet times
when each man hopes to live out his three score years
and ten.</p>

<p>In the year 1347 there happened a dreadful plague.
It began in Dorsetshire and spread over the whole of
the south country, reaching London last. After a
while the church-yards were not large enough to hold
the dead, and they were forced to enclose ground outside
the walls. The Bishop of London, therefore,
bought a piece of ground north of Bartholomew's,
called No Man's Ground, which he enclosed and consecrated,
building thereon a "fair chapel." This place
was called the Pardon Church-yard. It stood, as those
who know London will be interested to know, beyond
the north wall of the present Charter House.</p>

<p>Two years later, the plague still continuing, Sir
Walter Manny bought a plot of thirteen acres close to
this church-yard, and built a chapel upon it&mdash;it stood
somewhere in the middle of the present Charterhouse
Square&mdash;and gave it for an additional church-yard.
More than fifty thousand persons were buried here in
one year, according to Stow; but the number is impossible,
unless the whole of London died in that year.
There used to be a stone cross standing in the church-yard
with the following inscription:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>Anno Domini 1349, regnante magna pestilentia, consecratum
fuit hoc coemiterium in quo et infra septa presentis monasterii
sepulta fuerunt mortuorum corpora plus quam quinquaginta
millia praeter alia multa abhinc usque ad presens:
quorum animabus propitietur Deus. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<p>The old Pardon
Church-yard afterwards
became the burial-place
of suicides and executed
criminals. To this sad
place the bodies of such
were carried in a cart
belonging to St. John's
Hospital; the vehicle
was hung over with black,
but with a St. John's
Cross in front, and within
it hung a bell which
rang with the jolting and
the shaking of the cart&mdash;a
mournful sight to see
and a doleful sound to
hear.</p>

<img src="images/page_122.jpg" width="238" height="586" alt="CHURCH OF AUSTIN FRIARS" title="" />
<span class="caption">CHURCH OF AUSTIN FRIARS</span>
</div>

<p>Twenty-two years
later, when there had
been upward of a hundred
thousand persons
buried in the new church-yard,
Sir Walter Manny,
now grown old and near
his end, bought ten acres
more, which he gave to
the ground, and established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
here a House of Carthusians, called the Salutation.
At first he thought of making a college for a
warden, a dean, and twelve secular priests. On the
advice, however, of Simon Sudbury, Bishop of London,
he abandoned that project and established a
House of Carthusians.</p>

<p>The Cistercian Order was founded by one Stephen
Harding, originally a monk of Sherborne. He is said
by William of Malmesbury to have left his convent
and to have gone into France, where he practised "the
Liberal arts" until he fell into repentance, and was received
into the monastery of Molesmes, in Burgundy.
Here he found a little company of the brethren who
were not content with the Rule of the House, but desired
instruction and a rule more in accordance with
their Founder's intention. They seceded, therefore,
and established themselves at Citeaux, then entirely
covered with woods. This is their manner of life set
forth by the Chronicler:</p>

<blockquote><p>Certainly many of their regulations seem severe, and more
particularly these: they wear nothing made with furs or linen,
nor even that finely spun linen garment which we call Staminium;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
neither breeches, unless when sent on a journey, which
at their return they wash and restore. They have two tunics
with cowls, but no additional garment in winter, though, if
they think fit, in summer they may lighten their garb. They
sleep clad and girded, and never after matins return to their
beds; but they so order the time of matins that it shall be light
ere the lauds<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> begin; so intent are they on their rule, that they
think no jot or tittle of it should be disregarded. Directly after
these hymns they sing the prime, after which they go out to
work for stated hours. They complete whatever labor or service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
they have to perform by day without any other light. No
one is ever absent from the daily services, or from complines,
except the sick. The cellarer and hospitaller, after complines,
wait upon the guests, yet observing the strictest silence. The
abbat allows himself no indulgence beyond the others&mdash;everywhere
present&mdash;everywhere attending to his flock; except that
he does not eat with the rest, because his table is with the
strangers and the poor. Nevertheless, be he where he may,
he is equally sparing of food and speech; for never more than
two dishes are served either to him or to his company; lard
and meat never but to the sick. From the Ides of September
till Easter, through regard for whatever festival, they do not
take more than one meal a day, except on Sunday. They never
leave the cloister but for purpose of labor, nor do they
ever speak, either there or elsewhere, save only to the abbat
or prior. They pay unwearied attention to the canonical<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
services, making no addition to them except for the defunct.
They use in their divine service the Ambrosian chants<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and
hymns, as far as they were able to learn them at Milan. While
they bestow care on the stranger and the sick, they inflict intolerable
mortifications on their own bodies, for the health of
their souls.</p></blockquote>

<p>When we consider this death in life, this, suppression
of everything which makes life, this annihilation
of aims, ambitions, and natural affections, this destruction
of love, emotion, and passion, this mere
monotony of breathing, this wearisome futility and
vanity, this endless iteration of Litanies; when we remember
that hundreds of thousands in every Christian
country, men and women, voluntarily entered upon
this life, knowing beforehand what it was, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
they patiently endured it, we can in some measure
realize the intensity and the reality of the torments
which they believed to be provided for the vast majority
of mankind. There grew up, in the course of
years, rich monks and luxurious monks; but in the
early days of each order there was the austerity of the
Rule. And though here and there we find a brother
who rises to a spiritual level far above the letter of
his Order, the religion of the ordinary brother was
little more than the fear of Hell, with a sense of gratitude
to the Saints for snatching him out of the flames.</p>

<p>Most of the brethren, again, of the new and more
austere Orders, until they became rich, were simple and
illiterate. They wanted a rule of life which should
give them no chance of committing sin; like women,
they desired to be ruled in everything, even the most
trivial. At dinner, for instance, they were enjoined to
drink with both hands, and to incline the head when
served; in church they were not to clinch their hands
or to stretch out their legs; the whole day was mapped
out for them as it is for boys at school. From primes
(the daybreak service) till tierce, spiritual exercises;
from tierce till sext, and from nones till vespers, manual
labors; once every day private prayer at the altar;
silence in the cell; to ask for what was wanted after
nones; no conversation in the chapter, the cloisters,
or the church; from November till Easter conversation
on the customs of the Order; afterwards on the
Gospels, and so on. The effect on the common nature
would be to produce a breathing machine, incapable
of thought, of action, of judgment, with no affections,
emotions, or passions. The holy brotherhood
becomes a troop of slaves engaged upon a round of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
trivial duties, kept at a low stage of vitality by scanty
food and short sleep. They cease after a while to desire
any change; they go on in meekness and submission
to the end, their piety measured by their regularity.
Now and then among them is found one who
frets under the yoke. Either he wants new austerities,
like Stephen Harding, or he rises in mad revolt, and
before he can be suppressed commits such dreadful
sins of rebellion and blasphemy as leave little doubt
that after all his pains and privations his chances in
the next world are no better than those of the foul-mouthed
ruffler outside, whose life has been one long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
sin, whose death will be caused by a knife in a drunken
fray, whose body will be carried in the black cart
with the bell to Pardon Church-yard, and whose soul,
most certainly, will be borne to its own place by the
hands of the Devil to whom it belongs.</p>

<p>There must have been in every convent such times
of madness and revolt, even though the vital powers
were kept low with poor and scanty food. It is not
every man who can be thus changed into a slave and
a praying-machine. The noblest souls must break
out from time to time; only the ignoble sink contentedly
day by day into lethargic, passive, mechanical
discharge of the rules; their mouths mechanically
mumble the litanies; the sacredness falls out of the
most holy acts and words by reason of their familiarity;
they drop into second childhood in the vigor and
strength of manhood. If the walls of the convent
could speak, what tales would they tell of madness
and despair and vain rage and drivelling idiocy! One
thing, however, came to the relief of these poor men
in every order; it was the gradual relaxation of the
Rule, until, by the Dissolution, the laws of the Founder
had passed into forms and words, and the House, enriched
by benefactions, had become a pleasant club,
consisting of none but gentlemen, where certain light
duties removed the tedium of an idle life.</p>

<p>For two hundred years this House of the Salutation
continued. There remains no record of that long
period; no record at all. There is no history of those
poor souls who lived their dreary lives within its walls.
The monks obeyed the Rule and died and were forgotten.
Nay, they had been forgotten since the day when
they assumed the hood. The end of the Carthusians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
came in blood and prison and torture; but that belongs
to Tudor London.</p>

<p>The accompanying view (<a href="#THE_CHARTER_HOUSE">p. 130</a>) of the Charter House
after the Dissolution, and when Sutton had altered it
for his new Foundation, is useful in showing the arrangement
of the older monastic buildings. Chapel,
cloisters, courts, bowling green, kitchen garden, and
"wilderness" are all exactly as the monks left them,
though most of the buildings are of later date. The
founder, Sir Walter, lived to see only the commencement
of his work. He died the year after his House
was established, and was buried in the chapel, he and
his wife Margaret, and many other gallant knights and
gracious ladies, who thus acknowledged, when they
chose to be laid among the dust and ashes of the poor
folk who had died of the plague and those who had
died by the gibbet, their brotherhood with the poorest
and the humblest and the most unfortunate.</p>

<p>The modern visitor to London, when he has seen
great St. Bartholomew's, is taken up a street hard by.
Here, amid mean houses and shops of the lower class,
he sees standing across the road St. John's Gate, a
place already as well known to him and as frequently
figured as St. Paul's itself. This is the gate&mdash;and it is
nearly all that is left&mdash;of the great Priory of St. John
of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>It was founded in the year 1100, and therefore belongs
to Norman London. Its founder was Jordan
Briset, a Baron of the Realm, and Muriel, his wife.
They had already founded a priory for nuns close by
Clerkenwell. A church of some kind was certainly
built at the beginning, but the great Priory Church,
one of the most splendid in London, was not dedicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
till the year 1185, and then by no less a person
than by Heraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, then in England
in quest of aid and money for another Crusade.</p>

<p>In its Foundation the brethren took the vows of
chastity, obedience, and poverty. They were to have
a right to nothing but bread, water, and clothes. They
begged their food; on Wednesdays and Fridays they
fasted; a breach of their first vow was punished by
public flogging and penance; no women were to do
any offices at all for them; they were to be silent,
never to go about alone; they were to be the servants
of the sick and poor; they were valiantly to defend
the Cross. "Receive," says the ritual of admission,
"the yoke of the Lord: it is easy and light, and thou
shalt find rest for thy soul. We promise thee nothing
but bread and water, a simple habit of little worth.
We give thee, thy parents and relations, a share in the
good works performed by our Order and by our brethren,
both now and hereafter, throughout the world.
We place, O brother, this cross upon thy breast, that
thou mayest love it with all thy heart, and may thy
right hand ever fight in its defence! Should it happen
that in fighting against the enemies of the faith
thou shouldest desert the standard of the Cross and
take to flight, thou wilt be stripped of the holy sign
according to the statutes and customs of the Order, as
having broken its vows, and thou wilt be cut off from
our body."</p>

<p>This poor, valiant, and ascetic society became in two
hundred years enormously rich and luxurious. By its
pride and its tyranny it had incurred the most deadly
hatred of the common people, as is shown by their
behavior during the insurrection of Wat Tyler and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
John Bull. The first step of the rebels in Essex was
to destroy a fair manor-house belonging to the Knights
Hospitallers, and to devour and waste the stores of
food, wine, and clothes contained in it. On their way
to London they destroyed another manor belonging
to the Knights, that of Highbury. After they had
burned and pillaged Lambeth and the Savoy, they
went in a body to St. John's Priory and destroyed the
whole of the buildings, church and all. And they
seized and beheaded the Grand Prior, who was also
Treasurer of the Realm. The church soon rose again,
and the monastic buildings were replaced with more
than the ancient splendor, and the luxury of the
Knights was in no way diminished by this disaster.
The Gate itself, part of the later buildings, now belongs
to the English Knights of St. John, who have
established an ambulance station close beside it and
maintain a hospital at Jerusalem. The very beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
crypt of the church still stands and may be visited.
Part of the walls of the mean modern church also belongs
to the old church.</p>

<p>On the north side of the Priory and adjacent to it
lay the twin Foundation of Briset, the Priory of Black
Nuns. Its church, at the Dissolution, became the
Parish Church of St. James Clerkenwell. Jordan Briset
and his wife were buried in this church.</p>

<p>The Hospital of St. Mary of Bethlehem was situated
at first outside Bishopsgate, close to St. Botolph's
Church. This ancient Foundation, of which our Bethlehem
Hospital is the grandchild, was endowed by
one Simon Fitz Mary, Sheriff in the year 1247. It
was designed for a convent, the monks being obliged
to receive and entertain the Bishop of Bethlehem or
his nuncio whenever either should be in London. It
is said to have become a hospital within a few years
of its foundation. In the year 1347 the brethren
were all engaged in collecting alms. This was one of
the lesser Houses, though it survived the rest and became
the great and splendid Foundation which still
exists. A little farther north, and on the opposite
side of Bishopsgate Street, stood the great House of
St. Mary Spital&mdash;<i>Domus Dei et Beatæ Virginis</i>&mdash;founded
in the year 1197 by Walter Brune and Rosia his
wife. It was originally a Priory of Canons Regular.
At some time in its history, I know not when, it was
converted into a hospital, like its neighbor of Bethlehem.
It would be interesting to learn when this
change became even possible. It must have been
long after its foundation, when the old prayer-machine
theory had lost something of its earliest authority,
and, in the face of the mass of human suffering, men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
began to ask whether the machinery engaged in iterating
litanies might not be made more useful in the
alleviation of suffering. For whatever cause, the House
of God and the Blessed Virgin became St. Mary Spital,
and at the time of the Dissolution there were no
fewer than one hundred and eighty beds in the House.
Near St. Mary Spital was Holywell Nunnery. On
the south side of Aldgate, outside the wall, stood the
famous Abbey of St. Clare, called the Minories, founded
by Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, in the year 1293,
for the reception of certain nuns brought over by his
wife, Blanche, Queen of Navarre, who were professed
to serve God, the Blessed Virgin, and St. Francis.</p>

<p>There is a church, one of the meanest and smallest
of all the London churches, standing in the ugliest
and dreariest part of the City, called the Church of
the Holy Trinity, Minories, which is often visited by
Americans because the arms of Washington are to be
seen here; and by antiquaries, because the head of
the Duke of Suffolk, executed on Tower Hill, is preserved
here. The north wall of this church is part of
the wall of the Clare Sisters' Church, and is all that
remains in that squalid place of the noble Foundation.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Manny's Carthusian House was not the
only Foundation arising out of the great Plague of
1348. On the north-east of the Tower arose at the
same time a very stately House, dedicated to the
Honor of God and the Lady of Grace. It began exactly
in the same way as the Carthusians', by the purchase
of a piece of ground in which to bury those who
died of the plague. John Corey, Clerk, first bought
the ground, calling it the Church-yard of the Holy
Trinity. One Robert Elsing gave five pounds, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
other citizens contributing, the place was enclosed and
a chapel built on it. Then Edward III., remembering
a certain vow made during a certain tempest at
sea, in which he was only saved by the miraculous interposition
of the Virgin Mary herself, built here a
monastery which he called the House and King's
Free Chapel of the Blessed Virgin of Grace&mdash;"in memoriam
Gratiarum." The House obtained the Manor
of Gravesend and other rich benefactions. There is
little history that I have discovered belonging to it.
The people commonly called it either New Abbey
or Eastminster, and when it was surrendered its yearly
value was £546, equivalent to about £10,000 a
year as prices now obtain.</p>

<p>On the south side of Thames, besides St. Mary
Overies already noticed, there were two great Houses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span></p>

<p>The first of these, St. Thomas's Hospital, was founded
in the year 1213 by Richard, Prior of Bermondsey,
for converts and poor children. He called it the
Almery. Two years afterwards the Bishop of Winchester,
Peter de Rupibus, now founded the place for
Canons Regular. After the Dissolution it was purchased
by the City of London for a hospital for the
sick and poor.</p>

<p>The second, Bermondsey Abbey, though founded
as early as 1081 by one Alwyn Childe, Citizen, and
probably one of Fitz Stephen's thirteen conventual
churches, and a most interesting House from many
points of view, hardly comes within our limits. Portions
of the Abbey were standing until the beginning
of this century. All the then existing remains were
figured by Wilkinson; I have not been able to find a
fragment of it now remaining above-ground. Underground,
vaults, arches, and crypts undoubtedly remain,
and will be discovered from time to time as excavations
are made for new buildings. These great
Houses, all richly endowed with broad manors, devoured
a good part of the whole country. Their
schools, their learning, and their charities are matters
of sentiment if not of history. For the time came
when the school should become free of the monastery,
and when the vast estates formed for the benefit of
the monks should pass into the hands of the community.
Charity to the poor is a thing beautiful in itself;
better than to relieve the poor is to lessen the
necessity of poverty.</p>

<p>But this long list of great Houses by no means exhausts
the list. Besides these of the City, within it or
else around it, were many others, not so rich, yet well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
endowed. He, for instance, who walks along the
broad highway of Whitechapel and Mile End, if he
continues his walk, presently arrives at a most interesting
and venerable church. It is quite small, with
a low tower; it stands in the middle of the road, and
has a long, narrow church-yard, cigar-shaped, before
and behind it. This is the Church of St. Mary, or
Bow Church. It was formerly the Church of a nunnery
founded at Stratford-le-Bow by William the Conqueror;
it was augmented by Stephen, enriched by
Henry II. and Richard I., and it lasted till the Dissolution.
Let us remember that every new endowment
of a monastic House meant the sequestration of so
many acres of land; they were taken from the country
and given to the Church; they could never be
sold; the tenants could never acquire property or
rise in the world; all the lands owned by convents,
churches, or colleges were lands withdrawn forever (as
it seemed) from the healthy change and chance of private
property.</p>

<p>I do not think that Bow Church is mentioned in
any of the London hand-books. There is yet another
and a much more important and interesting Foundation
which, I believe, is not recommended by any
guide-book to the visitor. Yet Waltham Abbey Church
is a place of the greatest interest. It may almost
be ranked with Winchester, Westminster, Canterbury,
Caen, and Fontevrault as regards historic interest.
Moreover, it is at this day a place of singular beauty,
and is approached, by one who is well advised and
can give up to the visit a whole afternoon and evening,
by a most beautiful walk. The name Waltham
has been explained as the place of the wall. In that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
case, here was a "waste chester," a fortified enclosure
found by the East Saxons when they overran the
country, and left by them, as they left so many other
places, to fall into decay. It seems most likely, however,
that the name is Wealdham, the place of the
forest.</p>

<p>The history of Waltham begins with a famous wedding
feast. It is that of Tofig, the Royal Standard-bearer,
and it caused the death of a king, because
Hardeknut at this feast drank himself to death. The
great Danish Thane built here a hunting lodge, the
place being built in the midst of a mighty forest, of
which vestiges remain to this day at Hampstead,
Hornsey, and Epping. Now, Tofig held lands in
Somersetshire as well as in Middlesex. And at a place
called Lutgarsbury, which is now Montacute (<i>mons
acutus</i>), a singular peaked hill, there lived a smith,
who was moved in a dream to dig for a certain cross
which, it was revealed to him, lay buried underground.
He did so, and was rewarded by finding a splendid
cross of black marble covered with silver and set with
precious stones. When he had found it, he naturally
thought it his duty to convey it to the nearest great
monastery. In these days quite another course would
suggest itself to the fortunate rustic. This smith of
Lutgarsbury, therefore, placed the cross on the cart,
and informed the oxen that he was going to drive
them to Glastonbury, that holy House sacred to the
memory of Joseph of Arimathea himself, and illustrious
for its thorn flowering in midwinter. Miracle!
The oxen refused to move. The parish priest, called
in to advise, suggested Canterbury, only second to
Glastonbury in sanctity. Still these inspired animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
refused to move. Perhaps Winchester might be tried.
There they had the bones of St. Swithin. No, not
even to Winchester would they carry the cross.
"Then," said the priest, "let them carry the cross to
your master, Tofig, at Waltham." Strange to say,
though Waltham had no special sanctity, the intelligent
creatures immediately set off with the greatest
alacrity in the direction of Waltham, a hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
fifty miles away, and reached it after a ten days' journey,
bearing the cross safely.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 416px;"><a name="BOW_CHURCH_MILE_END_ROAD" id="BOW_CHURCH_MILE_END_ROAD"></a>
<img src="images/page_137.jpg" width="416" height="523" alt="BOW CHURCH, MILE END ROAD" title="" />
<span class="caption">BOW CHURCH, MILE END ROAD</span>
</div>

<p>The story is preserved in a tract, <i>De Inventione
Sanctæ Crucis Walthamensis</i>, and must be believed by
all the faithful. Thane Tofig showed his sense of
what was due to a miracle by building a church for
the reception of the cross, and appointing two canons
to serve the church. It is also said that at least sixty
persons were cured by means of this miraculous cross,
and that many of them continued to live near the
church in order to testify to its powers. When, a few
years later, Harold obtained possession of the estate,
he built a larger and more splendid church on the site,
and placed twelve instead of two canons in it, with a
dean and school-master. The church was consecrated
in the year 1060, in the presence of King Edward and
Edith his Queen. On his way south to meet William,
Harold stopped to pray before the cross. While he
prayed, the head on the cross, which had before looked
upward, bent forward, and so remained downcast.
On the field of Senlac, Harold's cry was "The Holy
Cross."</p>

<p>The body of the dead King was brought to the
church and buried in the chancel. Only the nave remains,
but there still stretches to the east a green space
which was once the chancel, and somewhere under
this green lawn lies the body of the last Saxon king.</p>

<p>William the Conqueror spared the Foundation. Henry
II. replaced Harold's canons by monks of Rule. He
is said to have rebuilt the church, but this is doubted.
Probably some of the existing part, the nave, contains
Harold's work, which was already Norman in character.
When, in 1307, the body of Edward I. was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
brought from the north to be buried in Westminster,
it lay for seventeen days in the Abbey Church of Waltham.
And the place is full of historical memories,
not only of kings, but of worthies. Cranmer here advised
Henry VIII. concerning his divorce. Thomas
Fuller here wrote his <i>Church History</i>. Foxe here wrote
his <i>Book of the Martyrs</i>. The church now stands on
the north side of a small and rather mean town; it is
in the midst of a large church-yard planted with yew-trees,
and set with benches for the old to sit among the
tombs. The grave of King Harold, somewhere under
the turf, has over it the circled firmament instead of
the lofty arch; instead of the monkish litanies it hears
the song of the lark and thrush; instead of the whisper
and the hushed footfall of the priests there is the
voice of the children playing in the town and the
multitudinous sound of work in the streets hard by.
A happy exchange!</p>

<p>In the Old Jewry there was established by Henry
III.&mdash;a Jewish synagogue being their first house&mdash;a
branch of a very singular order&mdash;the <i>Fratres de Penitentiâ
Jesu</i> or <i>Fratres de Saccâ</i>. They were mendicants
of the Franciscan Rule, and were dressed in sackcloth
to denote their poverty and their penitence. It
was another and one of the last endeavors after a return
to the early zeal and the first poverty of the
Order. For a time the new brotherhood enjoyed considerable
popularity; Queen Eleanor, wife of Edward
I., took them under her protection and endowed the
synagogue, which was all they had, with lands and
houses. Unhappily the Council of Lyons, 1274, ordered
that there should be recognized no other mendicant
friars except the Dominicans, the Minorites, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
Carmelites, and the Augustines. So one supposes
that these Brothers, just as they were getting comfortable
in their synagogue, and beginning to reap the
fruits of their austerities, had to turn out again, because
no one was allowed to give them anything, and
so went back to the common Orders, who would not
allow even the wearing of the sackcloth. One is sorry
for the poor men so proud of their sackcloth and with
such encouraging recognition already won.</p>

<p>Again, there is not much in
the modern Church of St. Giles
in the Fields to suggest the
past&mdash;a large stone church with a church-yard, standing
in a miserable district, which for two hundred
years has been the haunt of criminals and vagabonds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
Yet here was one of the very earliest Houses of piety
and charity. Here was perhaps the earliest hospital
founded in this land of Britain. It was instituted by
Queen Maud, wife of Henry I., as a lazar-house for
lepers and other poor sick men. What became of the
lepers when there was no house for them? They crept
into empty hovels; they perished miserably, outcast,
neglected. So long as they were strong enough to
creep out they begged their bread; when they could
no longer crawl, they lay down and died. Thanks to
the good Queen, some of them, at least, were cared for
in their last days. A sweet fragrance of thanksgiving
lingers still about the slums of St. Giles. The poor
lepers who lie buried in that squalid church-yard still
uplift a voice of praise for those who remember the
sick and all that are desolate and sore oppressed.</p>

<p>Nor is there at Charing Cross much to remind the
visitor of the past. Yet here was a Foundation somewhat
unusual of its kind. It was an "alien" House.
The Chapel, Hospital, or House of St. Mary Rounceval
was founded by William Marshall, Earl of Pembroke,
who gave certain tenements to the Prior of Rounceval,
or <i>de Roscida Valle</i>, in the Diocese of Pampeluna,
Navarre. It was a House for eleven brethren. Henry
IV. suppressed all alien priories, this among the rest,
but it was restored by Edward IV. as a Fraternity.
After the Dissolution the site of the House was used
by the Earl of Northampton for the palace which,
under the name of Northumberland House, stood
until the other day, the last of the river-side palaces.</p>

<p>Other great Houses are sometimes reckoned as
London Houses, such as those of Barking, Wimbledon,
Merton, and Chertsey; but these are outside our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
limits. Nor can I touch here upon any of the religious
Foundations of Westminster.</p>

<p>We have seen that when we lay down the monastic
establishments upon the map, they occupy a very considerable
part of the area within the walls. But when
we consider, in addition, the great number of smaller
Foundations, the colleges, hospitals, and fraternities
with Houses, the parish churches and the church-yards,
we shall begin to understand that the space required
for ecclesiastical buildings alone in the confined area
of a mediæval town gives a very fair idea of the power
and authority of the Church.</p>

<p>After the Monasteries come the Colleges, so called,
by which we must not understand seats of learning,
but colleges of priests. There were several of these:</p>

<p>First, that of St. Thomas of Acon. The college
was founded by Agnes, sister of Thomas à Becket.
She endowed it with her father's property in London.
It stood on the site of the present Mercers' Chapel,
and was built on the spot where the new saint was
born. The Mercers' Chapel, however, occupies only
a portion of the splendid church which was destroyed
in the Great Fire. The Foundation received many
endowments, and at the Dissolution its income was
nearly £300 a year, equal to twenty times as much
of modern money. The City, naturally proud of its
saint, observed a curious annual function in connection
with this college. On the afternoon of the day
when he was sworn at the Exchequer, the new Lord
Mayor, with the Aldermen, met at this chapel and
thence proceeded to St. Paul's, where first they prayed
for the soul of Bishop William&mdash;who had been Bishop
of London in the time of William the Conqueror.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
This done, they repaired to the tomb of Gilbert à
Becket, in Pardon Church-yard, and there prayed for
all faithful souls departed. Then they returned to
St. Thomas Acon and made an offering. Nothing
is said about the evening, but one hopes that the day
was concluded in the cheerful manner common at all
times with London citizens.</p>

<p>Next, the College of Whittington.</p>

<p>This noble and wealthy merchant rebuilt the Church
of St. Michael, called Paternoster in the Royal, and
attached to it a College of St. Spirit and St. Mary for
a master, from fellows, clerks, conducts, and choristers,
together with an almshouse for thirteen poor men.
They were all bound to pray for the soul of Sir Richard
Whittington and his wife, Dame Alice; also for
those of Sir William Whittington and Dame Joan,
his wife, the parents of the founder. The college was
swept away at the Dissolution; the almshouse remained
and was rebuilt after the Fire. They are now
removed to Highgate, but a conventual feeling still
lingers about the buildings at the back of the church.</p>

<p>Then follows St. Michael's College, Crooked Lane.</p>

<p>Sir William Walworth, the valiant Mayor who killed
Wat Tyler, founded a college of one master and
nine chaplains to say mass in St. Michael's Church,
the choir and the aisles of which he rebuilt.</p>

<p>And there was also Jesus Commons.</p>

<p>This Foundation seems to have resembled that of
All-Souls, Oxford, in that its fellows had no duties to
perform except the services of their chapel. It is
described as a fair house in Dowgate (no doubt built
round a small quadrangle), well furnished with everything
and containing a good library, all for the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
those who lived there&mdash;a peaceful, quiet place, without
any history. One thinks of the day when it had
to be dissolved, and the poor old priests, who had
lived so long in the house, were driven forth into the
streets. Not even submission to the king's supremacy
could save the tenants of Jesus Commons. The
house itself was pulled down and tenements built in
its place.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar House was a small and very interesting
Foundation called the Papey. It was a college
for poor and aged priests. In any old map the
church called St. Augustine Papey may be seen at
the north end of St. Mary Axe nestled under the wall,
with a piece of ground adjoining, which may have
been a garden and may have been a burial-ground.
We find the poor old priests taking part in funerals,
and, I daresay, in any other function by which their
slender provision might be augmented.</p>

<p>Next to the Colleges come the Hospitals. St. Bartholomew's,
most ancient and richest, belongs to Norman
London.</p>

<p>One who walks along the street called London Wall
will chance upon a church-yard, on the north side of
which still stands a fragment of the old wall. This
church-yard, narrow and small, is surrounded on three
sides by warehouses; on the fourth side it looks upon
the street. On the other side of the street is a large
block of warehouses, the monument of a most disgraceful
and shameful act of vandalism. On this spot
stood Elsing Spital. It was founded in the year 1329
as a priory and hospital for the maintenance of a hundred
blind men by one William Elsing, its first Prior.
On the dissolution of the religious houses, Elsing's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
Spital surrendered with the rest, and was dissolved.
What became of the blind men is not known. Then
they took the fine Priory Church, and having pulled
down the north aisle&mdash;on the site of which houses
were built&mdash;they converted the rest of the church into
the parish church of St. Alphege, which had previously
stood in Cripplegate. The site of the old church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
was turned into a carpenter's yard. The porch of St.
Alphege remains of the ancient buildings. Of Sion
College, which in course of time succeeded Elsing's
Spital, we will speak in another place.</p>

<p>That splendid Foundation which rears its wards on
the south of the Thames, over against the Houses of
Parliament, St. Thomas's Hospital, was founded in
1313 as an almery, or house of alms for converts and
poor children; but two years later the House was refounded
on a much larger scale. After the Dissolution,
its site, then in Southwark, was purchased by
the citizens of London. To sum up, London was as
well provided with hospitals in the fourteenth century
as it was with convents and religious houses. They
were St. Bartholomew's, Elsing Spital, St. Giles Cripplegate,
St. Mary Spital, St. Mary of Bethlehem, St.
Thomas Southwark, and the Lazar House of Southwark.</p>

<p>These hospitals, it must be borne in mind, were all
religious Foundations governed by brethren of some
Order. Religion ruled all. From the birth of the child
to the death of the man religion, the forms, duties,
and obedience due to religion, attended every one.
No one thought it possible that it could be otherwise.
The emancipation of mankind from the thrall of the
Church, incomplete to the present day, had then hardly
yet begun. All learning, all science, all the arts,
all the professions, were in the hands of the Church.
It is very easy to congratulate ourselves upon the removal
of these chains. Yet they were certainly a
necessary part of human development. Order, love
of law, respect for human life, education in the power
of self-government, such material advance as prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
the way&mdash;all these things had to be taught. No one
could teach them or enforce them but the priest, by
the authority and in the wisdom of the Church. On
the whole, he did his best. At the darkest time the
Church was always a little in advance of the people;
the Church at the lowest preserved some standard of
morals, and of conduct; and even if the standard was
low, why, it was higher than that of the laity.</p>

<p>When we see the Franciscans preaching to the people;
the Carthusians cowering silent and gloomy in
their cells; the Dominicans insisting on the letter of
the Faith; kings and queens and great lords trying to
get buried in the holy soil of a monastery church&mdash;let
us recognize that, out of this discipline emerged the
Londoner of Queen Bess, eager for adventure and for
enterprise; the Londoner who was so stout for liberty
that he drove out one king and then another king,
and set aside a dynasty for the sacred cause; the
Londoner of our own time, who is no whit inferior to
his forefathers.</p>

<p>One other form of religious society must be mentioned&mdash;that
of the Fraternity. There were Fraternities
attached to every church. Those of the same
trade in a parish&mdash;those of the same trade in many
parishes&mdash;united together in a Fraternity&mdash;of the
Blessed Virgin, of the Holy Trinity, of the Corpus
Christi, of Saint this or that. All the Danes in London
joined together to make a Fraternity&mdash;or all the
Dutch. All the fish-mongers, or all the pepperers;
they formed Fraternities&mdash;not yet trades-unions or
companies&mdash;which had masses sung for the souls of
their brethren; met in the churches on their Saint's
Day; had solemn service and a procession and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
feast. It is only by such a bond as this that any calling
or trade can become dignified, self-respecting, and
independent. The Fraternities were founded, for the
most part, before the Companies. These could not
have existed at all but for the impetus to union given
by the Fraternities. Common action&mdash;the most important
discovery ever made for the common welfare&mdash;was
made possible, among those who would otherwise
have been torn asunder by rivalries and trade
jealousies, by the Fraternities.</p>

<p>Among the thirty-one who formed the goodly company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
which pilgrimized to Canterbury with Chaucer,
twelve belonged to the Church. Was this proportion
accidental? I think not. Chaucer placed in his company
such a proportion of ecclesiastics as would be
expected on such an occasion. The portraits of Chaucer
are taken from the life: he saw them in the streets
of London; in the houses; in the churches. It helps
us to understand the City, only to read those portraits
over again. Are they so well known that it is superfluous
to do more than refer to them? Perhaps not.
Let us take them briefly. There is the Prioress, who
has with her a nun for chaplain and three priests. She
is a gentlewoman, smiling, coy, dainty in her habits
and in her dress; she is tender-hearted and fond of
pets; the nun's wimple is plaited; on her arm she
wears beads with a gold brooch&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On whiche was first y-written a crowned A,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after Amor vincit omnia.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She is lively, affectionate, and amiable, but she affects
dignity as a Prioress should. Clearly the superior of
an Order whose vows are not too strict, and whose austerities
respect the weakness of the sex. Who does
not know, at the present day, hundreds of gentle maiden
ladies who might sit for the portrait of the Prioress?</p>

<p>Then comes the Limitour, one who held the Bishop's
license to hear confessions, and to officiate within
a certain district. This fellow is everybody's friend
so long as he gets paid: the country gentlemen like
him, and the good wives like him, because he hears
confessions sweetly, and enjoins easy penance; he
could sing and play; he could drink; he knew all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
taverns; he was to appearance a merry, careless toper;
in reality, he was courteous only to the rich, and
thought continually about his gains. He kept his
district to himself, buying off those who tried to practise
within his limits. A natural product, the Limitour,
of a time when outward forms make up all the religion
that is demanded.</p>

<p>The Oxford Clerk has no benefice because he has no
interest. All the money that he got he spent in
books; his horse was lean; he himself was lean and
hollow. He travels to foreign universities in order to
converse with scholars.</p>

<p>The Monk was a big, brawny man, bald-headed, and
his robe was trimmed with fur; a great hunter who
kept greyhounds and had many horses. He was fat
and in good point; he loved a fat swan best of any
roast; he wore a gold pin with a love knot. Obedience
to the Rules of his Order is not, it seems, ever
expected of such a man.</p>

<p>The Town Parson, of low origin, a learned man
who loved his people, and was content with poverty,
and gave all to the poor, and was ever at their service
in all weathers. The picture of the good clergyman
might serve for to-day. His parish was wide, but he
went about</p>

<p>If such pictures as these could be drawn and freely
circulated, the first step was taken towards the Reformation.
Only the first step. Before Reformation
comes there must be more than the clear eyes of the
prophets able to see and to proclaim the truth. The
eyes of the people must be washed so that they, too,
can discern the truth behind these splendid vestments
and this gorgeous structure of authority.</p>

<p>Such, so great, was the power and the wealth of the
Church from the twelfth to the sixteenth century.
Every street had its parish church with charities and
Fraternities and endowments; colleges, Houses for
priests, almeries, hospitals, were scattered all about
the City; within and without the wall there were
fifteen great Houses, whose splendor can only be understood
by the ruins of Tintern, Glastonbury, Fountains,
or Whitby. Every House was possessed of rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
manors and broad lands; every House had its treasury
filled with title-deeds as well as with heaps of gold and
silver plate; every House had its church crowded with
marble monuments, adorned with rich shrines and
blazing altars and painted glass, such as we can no
longer make. Outside, the humblest parish church
showed on its frescoed walls the warnings of Death
and Judgment, the certainty of Heaven and Hell.
And they thought&mdash;priest and people alike&mdash;that it
was all going to last forever. Humanity had no other
earthly hope than a continuance of the bells of <i>l'Ile
Sonnante</i>.</p>

<p>It is never safe to adopt in blind confidence the
conclusions of the antiquary. He works with
fragments; here it is a passage in an old deed; here a
few lines of poetry; here a broken vase; here the capital
of a column; here a drawing, cramped, and out of
proportion, and dwarfed, from an illuminated manuscript.
This kind of work tends to belittle everything;
the splendid city becomes a mean, small town; King
Solomon's Temple, glorious and vast, shrinks to the
dimensions of a village conventicle; Behemoth himself
becomes an alligator; Leviathan, a porpoise; history,
read by this reducing lens, becomes a series of
patriotic exaggerations. For instance, the late Dr.
Brewer, a true antiquary, if ever there was one, could
see in mediæval London nothing but a collection of
mean and low tenements standing among squalid
streets and filthy lanes. That this estimate of the
City is wholly incorrect we shall now proceed to show.
Any city, ancient or modern, might be described as
consisting of mean and squalid houses, because in
every city the poor outnumber the rich, and the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
houses of the poor are more frequent than the mansions
of the wealthy.</p>

<p>When one who wishes to reconstruct a city of the past
has obtained from the antiquary all he has discovered,
and from the historian all he has to tell, there is yet
another field of research open to him before he begins
his task. It is the place itself&mdash;the <i>terrain</i>&mdash;the site
of the town, or the modern
town upon the site
of the old. He must examine
that; prowl about
it; search into it; consider
the neglected corners
of it. I will give an
example. Fifty years
ago a certain learned antiquary
and scholar visited
the site of an ancient
Syrian city, now
sadly reduced, and little
more than a village. He
looked at the place&mdash;he
did not explore it, he
looked at it&mdash;he then
read whatever history
has found to say of it;
he proceeded to prove that the place could never
have been more than a small and insignificant town
composed of huts and inhabited by fishermen. Those
who spoke of it as a magnificent city he called enthusiasts
or liars. Forty years passed; then another
man came; he not only visited the site, but examined
it, surveyed it, and explored it. This man discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
that the place had formerly possessed a wall&mdash;the
remains still existing&mdash;two miles and more in length;
an acropolis, strong and well situated&mdash;the ruins still
standing&mdash;protecting a noble city with splendid buildings.
The antiquary, you see, dealing with little fragments,
could not rise above them; his fragments
seemed to belong to a whole which was puny and insignificant.
This antiquary was Dr. Robinson, and
the place was the once famous city of Tiberias, by the
shores of the Galilean lake.</p>

<p>In exactly the same manner, he who would understand
mediæval London must walk about modern
London, but after <i>he has read his historian and his
antiquary</i>, not before. Then he will be astonished to
find how much is left, in spite of fires, reconstructions
and demolitions, to illustrate the past.</p>

<p>Here a quaint little square, accessible only to foot-passengers,
shut in, surrounded by merchants' offices,
still preserves its ancient form of a court in a suppressed
monastery. Since the church is close by, one ought
to be able to assign the court to its proper purpose.
The hall, the chapter-house, the kitchens and buttery,
the abbot's residence, may have been built around
this court.</p>

<p>Again, another little square set with trees, like a
Place in Toulon or Marseilles, shows the former court
of a royal palace. And here a venerable name survives
telling what once stood on the site; here a dingy
little church-yard marks the former position of a
church as ancient as any in the City.</p>

<p>London is full of such survivals, which are known
only to one who prowls about its streets, note-book in
hand, remembering what he has read. Not one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
them can be got from the book antiquary, or from the
guide-book. As one after the other is recovered the
ancient city grows not only more vivid, but more picturesque
and more splendid. London a city of low
mean tenements? Dr. Brewer&mdash;Dr. Brewer! Why, I
see great palaces along the river-bank between the
quays and ports and warehouses. In the narrow lanes
that rise steeply from the river I see other houses fair
and stately, each with its gate-way, its square court,
and its noble hall, high roofed, with its oriel-windows
and its lantern. Beyond these narrow lanes, north of
Watling Street and Budge Row, more of those houses&mdash;and
still more, till we reach the northern part where
the houses are nearly all small, because here the
meaner sort and those who carry on the least desirable
trades have those dwellings.</p>

<p>You have seen that London was full of rich monasteries,
nunneries, colleges, and parish churches, in
so much that it might be likened unto the <i>Ile Sonnante</i>
of Rabelais. You have now to learn, what I believe
no one has ever yet pointed out, that if it could be
called a city of churches it was much more a city of
palaces. This shall immediately be made clear. There
were, in fact, in London itself more palaces than in
Verona and Florence and Venice and Genoa all together.
There was not, it is true, a line of marble
<i>palazzi</i> along the banks of a Grande Canale; there was
no Piazza della Signoria, no Piazza della Erbe to show
these buildings. They were scattered about all over
the City; they were built without regard to general
effect and with no idea of decoration or picturesqueness;
they lay hidden in narrow winding labyrinthine
streets; the warehouses stood beside and between
them; the common people dwelt in narrow courts
around them; they faced each other on opposite sides
of the lanes.</p>

<p>These palaces belonged to the great nobles and
were their town houses; they were capacious enough
to accommodate the whole of a baron's retinue, consisting
sometimes of four, six, or even eight hundred
men. Let us remark that the continual presence of
these lords and their following did much more for the
City than merely to add to its splendor by the erecting
of great houses. By their residence they prevented
the place from becoming merely a trading centre
or an aggregate of merchants; they kept the citizens
in touch with the rest of the kingdom; they made the
people of London understand that they belonged to
the Realm of England. When Warwick, the King-maker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
rode through the streets to his town-house,
followed by five hundred retainers in his livery; when
King Edward the Fourth brought wife and children
to the City and left them there under the protection
of the Londoners while he rode out to fight for his
crown; when a royal tournament was held in Chepe&mdash;the
Queen and her ladies looking on&mdash;then the very
school-boys learned and understood that there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
more in the world than mere buying and selling, importing
and exporting; that everything must not be
measured by profit; that they were traders indeed,
and yet subjects of an ancient crown; that their own
prosperity stood or fell with the well-doing of the
country. This it was which made the Londoners ardent
politicians from very early times; they knew the
party leaders who had lived among them; the City
was compelled to take a side, and the citizens quickly
perceived that their own side always won&mdash;a thing
which gratified their pride. In a word, the presence
in their midst of king and nobles made them look beyond
their walls. London was never a Ghent; nor
was it a Venice. It was never London for itself
against the world, but always London for England
first, and for its own interests next.</p>

<p>Again, the City palaces, the town-houses of the
nobles, were at no time, it must be remembered, fortresses.
The only fortress of the City was the White
Tower. The houses were neither castellated nor fortified
nor garrisoned. They were entered by a gate,
but there was neither ditch nor portcullis. The gate&mdash;only
a pair of wooden doors&mdash;led into an open court
round which the buildings stood. Examples of this
way of building may still be seen in London. For
instance, Staple Inn, or Barnard's Inn, affords an excellent
illustration of a mediæval mansion. There
are in each two square courts with a gate-way leading
from the road into the Inn. Between the courts is a
hall with its kitchen and buttery. Clifford's Inn,
Gray's Inn and Old Square, Lincoln's Inn are also
good examples. Sion College, before they wickedly
destroyed it, showed the hall and the court. Hampton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
Court is a late example, the position of the Hall
having been changed. Gresham House was built
about a court. So was the Mansion House. Till a
few years ago Northumberland House, at Charing
Cross, illustrated the disposition of such mansions.
Those who walk down Queen Victoria Street in the
City pass on the north side a red brick house standing
round three sides of a quadrangle. This is the Herald's
College; a few years ago it preserved its fourth
side with its gate-way. Four hundred years ago this
was the town-house of the Earls of Derby. Restore
the front and you have the size of a great noble's
town palace, yet not one of the largest. If you wish
to understand the disposition of such a building as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
nobleman's town-house, compare it with the Quadrangle
of Clare, or that of Queens', Cambridge. Derby
House was burned down in the Fire, and was rebuilt
without its hall, kitchen, and butteries, for which there
was no longer any use. As it was before the Fire, a
broad and noble arch with a low tower, but showing
no appearance of fortification, opened into the square
court which was used as an exercising ground for the
men at arms. In the rooms around the court was
their sleeping accommodation; at the side or opposite
the entrance stood the hall where the whole household
took meals; opposite to the hall was the kitchen
with its butteries; over the butteries was the room
called the Solar, where the Earl and Countess slept;
beyond the hall was another room called the Lady's
Bower, where the ladies could retire from the rough
talk of the followers. We have already spoken of
this arrangement. The houses beside the river were
provided with stairs, at the foot of which was the
state barge in which my Lord and my Lady took the
air on fine days, and were rowed to and from the
Court at Westminster.</p>

<p>There remains nothing of these houses. They are,
with one exception, all swept away. Yet the description
of one or two, the site of others, and the actual
remains of one sufficiently prove their magnificence.
Let us take one or two about which something is
known. For instance, there is Baynard's Castle, the
name of which still survives in that of Baynard's
Castle Ward, and in that of a wharf which is still
called by the name of the old palace.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 278px;"><a name="THE_COLLEGE_OF_ARMS" id="THE_COLLEGE_OF_ARMS"></a>

<span class="caption">THE COLLEGE OF ARMS, OR
HERALD&#39;S OFFICE</span>
</div>

<p>Baynard's Castle stood first on the river-bank close
to the Fleet Tower and the western extremity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
wall. The great house which afterwards bore this
name was on the bank, but a little more to the east.
There was no house in the City more interesting than
this. Its history extends from the Norman Conquest
to the Great Fire&mdash;exactly six hundred years; and
during the whole of this long period it was a great
palace. First it was built by one Baynard, follower
of William. It was forfeited in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1111, and given
to Robert Fitzwalter, son of Richard, Earl of Clare,
in whose family the office of Castellan and Standard-bearer
to the City of London became hereditary. His
descendant, Robert, in revenge for private injuries,
took part with the Barons against King John, for
which the King ordered Baynard's Castle to be destroyed.
Fitzwalter, however, becoming reconciled
to the King, was
permitted to rebuild
his house.
It was again destroyed,
this time
by fire, in 1428.
It was rebuilt by
Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester,
on whose attainder it reverted
to the crown. During
one of these rebuildings
it was somewhat shifted in
position. Richard, Duke of
York, next had it, and lived
here with his following of four hundred gentlemen
and men at arms. It was in the hall of Baynard's Castle
that Edward IV. assumed the title of king, and
summoned the bishops, peers, and judges to meet him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
in council. Edward gave the house to his mother,
and placed in it for safety his wife and children before
going out to fight the battle of Barnet. Here
Buckingham offered the crown to Richard.</p>

<p>Henry VIII. lived in this palace, which he almost
entirely rebuilt. Prince Henry, after his marriage
with Catherine of Aragon, was conducted in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
state up the river, from Baynard's Castle to Westminster,
the Mayor and Commonalty of the City following
in their barges. In the time of Edward VI. the
Earl of Pembroke, whose wife was sister to Queen
Catharine Parr, held great state in this house. Here
he proclaimed Queen Mary. When Mary's first Parliament
was held, he proceeded to Baynard's Castle,
followed by "2000 horsemen in velvet coats with
their laces of gold and gold chains, besides sixty gentlemen
in blue coats with his badge of the green
dragon." This powerful noble lived to entertain
Queen Elizabeth at Baynard's Castle with a banquet,
followed by fireworks. The last appearance of the
place in history is when Charles II. took supper there
just before the Fire swept over it and destroyed it.</p>

<p>Another house by the river was that called Cold
Harborough, or Cold Inn.</p>

<p>This house stood to the west of the old Swan
Stairs. It was built by a rich City merchant, Sir John
Poultney, four times Mayor of London. At the end
of the fourteenth century it belonged, however, to
John Holland, Duke of Exeter, son of Thomas Holland,
Duke of Kent, and Joan Plantagenet, the "Fair
Maid of Kent." He was half-brother to King Richard
II., whom here he entertained. Richard III. gave
it to the Heralds for their college. They were turned
out, however, by Henry VII., who gave the house to
his mother, Margaret, Countess of Richmond. His
son gave it to the Earl of Shrewsbury, by whose son
it was taken down, one knows not why, and mean
tenements erected in its place for the river-side working-men.</p>

<p>Another royal residence was the house called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
Erber. This house also has a long history. It is said
to have been first built by the Knight Pont de l'Arche,
founder of the Priory of St. Mary Overies. Edward
III. gave it to Geoffrey le Scrope. It passed from him
to John, Lord Neville, of Raby, and so to his son
Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmoreland, the stanch supporter
of Henry IV. From him the Erber passed into
the hands of another branch of the Nevilles, the Earls
of Salisbury and Warwick. The King-maker resided
here, with a following so numerous that six oxen were
daily consumed for breakfast alone, and any person
who was allowed within the gates could take away as
much meat, sodden and roast, as he could carry upon
a long dagger. After his death, George, Duke of
Clarence&mdash;"false, fleeting, perjured Clarence"&mdash;obtained
a grant of the house, in right of his wife, Isabel,
daughter of Warwick. Richard, Duke of Gloucester,
succeeded, and called it the King's Palace during his
brief reign. Edward, son of the Duke of Clarence,
then obtained it. In the year 1584 the place, which
seems to have fallen into decay, was rebuilt by Sir
Thomas Pulsdon, Lord Mayor. Its last illustrious occupant,
according to Stow, was Sir Francis Drake.</p>

<p>We are fortunate in having left one house at least,
or a fragment of one, out of the many London palaces.
The Fire of 1666 spared Crosby Place, and though
most of the old mansion has been pulled down, there
yet remains the Hall, the so-called Throne Room, and
the so-called Council Room. The mansion formerly
covered the greater part of what is now called Crosby
Square. It was built by a simple citizen, a grocer
and Lord Mayor, Sir John Crosby, in the fifteenth
century; a man of great wealth and great position;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
a merchant, diplomatist, and ambassador. He rode
north to welcome Edward IV. when he landed at
Ravenspur; he was sent by the King on a mission to
the Duke of Burgundy and to the Duke of Brittany.
Shakespeare makes Richard of Gloucester living in
this house as early as 1471, four years before the
death of Sir John Crosby, a thing not likely. But he
was living here at the death of Edward IV., and here
he held his <i>levées</i> before his usurpation of the crown.
In this hall, where now the City clerks snatch a hasty
dinner, sat the last and worst of the Plantagenets,
thinking of the two boys who stood between him and
the crown. Here he received the news of their murder.
Here he feasted with his friends. The place is charged
with the memory of Richard Plantagenet. Early in
the next century another Lord Mayor obtained it, and
lent it to the ambassador of the Emperor Maximilian.
It passed next into the hands of a third citizen, also
Lord Mayor, and was bought in 1516 by Sir Thomas
More, who lived here for seven years, and wrote in this
house his <i>Utopia</i> and his <i>Life of Richard the Third</i>.
His friend, Antonio Bonvici, a merchant of Lucca,
next lived in the house. To him More wrote his well-known
letter from the Tower. William Roper, More's
son-in-law, and William Rustill, his nephew; Sir
Thomas d'Arcy; William Bond, Alderman and Sheriff,
and merchant adventurer; Sir John Spencer, ancestor
of Lord Northampton; Mary, Countess of Pembroke,
and sister of Sir Philip Sidney&mdash;</p>

<p>the Earl of Northampton, who accompanied Charles
I. to Madrid on his romantic journey; Sir Stephen
Langham&mdash;were successive owners or occupants of
this house. It was partly destroyed by fire&mdash;not the
Great Fire&mdash;in the reign of Charles II. The Hall, which
escaped, was for seventy years a Presbyterian meeting-house;
it then became a packer's warehouse. Sixty
years ago it was partly restored, and became a literary
institution. It is now a restaurant, gaudy with color
and gilding. The Duc de Biron, ambassador from
France in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was lodged
here, with four hundred noblemen and gentlemen in
his train. And here also was lodged the Duc de
Sully.</p>

<p>In a narrow street in the City, called Tower Royal&mdash;Tour
De La Reole, built by merchants from Bordeaux&mdash;survives
the name of a house where King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
Stephen lived in the short intervals when he was not
fighting; King Richard II. gave it to his mother, and
called it the Queen's Wardrobe; he afterwards assigned
it to Leon III., King of Armenia, who had
been dispossessed by the Turks. Richard III. gave
it to John, Duke of Norfolk, who lived here until his
death at the battle of Bosworth Field. There is no
description of the house, which must have had a tower
of some kind, and there is no record of its demolition:
Stow only says that "of late times it has been neglected
and turned into stabling for the king's horses,
and is now let out to divers men, and is divided into
tenements."</p>

<p>The Heralds' College in Queen Victoria Street, already
mentioned, stands on the site of Derby House.
Here the first Earl, who married the mother of Henry
VII., lived. Here the Princess Elizabeth of York
was the guest of the Earl during the usurpation of
Richard. The house was destroyed in the Fire and
rebuilt in a quadrangle, of which the front portion
was removed to make room for the new street.</p>

<p>Half a dozen great houses do not make a city of
palaces. That is true. Let us find others. Here,
then, is a list, by no means exhaustive, drawn up
from the pages of Stow. The Fitz Alans, Earls of
Arundel, had their town house in Botolph Lane, Billingsgate,
down to the end of the sixteenth century.
The street is and always has been narrow, and, from
its proximity to the fish-market, is and always has
been unsavory. The Earls of Northumberland had
town houses successively in Crutched Friars, Fenchurch
Street, and Aldersgate Street. The Earls of
Worcester lived in Worcester Lane, on the river-bank;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
the Duke of Buckingham on College Hill: observe
how the nobles, like the merchants, built their houses
in the most busy part of the town. The Beaumonts
and the Huntingdons lived beside Paul's Wharf; the
Lords of Berkeley had a house near Blackfriars; Doctor's
Commons was the town house of the Blounts,
Lords Mountjoy. Close to Paul's Wharf stood the
mansion once occupied by the widow of Richard,
Duke of York, mother of Edward IV., Clarence, and
Richard III. Edward the Black Prince lived on Fish
Street Hill; the house was afterwards turned into an
inn. The De la Poles had a house in Lombard Street.
The De Veres, Earls of Oxford, lived first in St. Mary
Axe, and afterwards in Oxford Court, St. Swithin's
Lane; Cromwell, Earl of Essex, had a house in Throgmorton
Street. The Barons Fitzwalter had a house
where now stands Grocers' Hall, Poultry. In Aldersgate
Street were houses of the Earl of Westmoreland,
the Earl of Northumberland, and the Earl of Thanet,
Lord Percie, and the Marquis of Dorchester. Suffolk
Lane marks the site of the "Manor of the Rose," belonging
successively to the Suffolks and the Buckinghams;
Lovell's Court, Paternoster Row, marks the
site of the Lovells' mansion; between Amen Corner
and Ludgate Street stood Abergavenny House, where
lived in the reign of Edward II. the Earl of Richmond
and Duke of Brittany, grandson of Henry III. Afterwards
it became the house of John Hastings, Earl
of Pembroke, who married Lady Margaret, daughter
of Edward III. It passed to the Nevilles, Earls of
Abergavenny, and from them to the Stationers' Company.
Warwick Lane runs over Warwick House.
The Sidneys, Earls of Leicester, lived in the Old Bailey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
The Staffords, Dukes of Buckingham, lived in
Milk Street.</p>

<p>Such a list, numbering no fewer than thirty-five palaces&mdash;which
is not exhaustive and does not include
the town houses of the Bishops and great Abbots, nor
the halls of the companies, many of them very noble,
nor the houses used for the business of the City, as
Blackwell Hall and Guildhall&mdash;is, I think, sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
to prove my statement that London was a city of
palaces.</p>

<p>Nothing, again, has been said about the houses of
the rich merchants, some of which were much finer
than those of the nobles. Crosby Hall, as has been
seen, was built by a merchant. In Basing Lane (now
swallowed up by those greedy devourers of old houses,
Cannon Street and Queen Victoria Street), stood
Gerrard's Hall, with a Norman Crypt and a high-roofed
Hall, where once they kept a Maypole and called it
Giant Gerrard's staff. This was the hall of the house
built by John Gisors, Mayor in the year 1305. The
Vintners' Hall stands on the site of a great house
built by Sir John Stodie, Mayor in 1357. In the
house called the Vintry, Sir Henry Picard, Mayor, once
entertained a very noble company indeed. Among
them were King Edward III., King John of France,
King David of Scotland, the King of Cyprus, and the
Black Prince. After the banquet they gambled, the
Lord Mayor defending the bank against all comers with
dice and hazard. The King of Cyprus lost his money,
and, unfortunately, his Royal temper as well. To lose
the latter was a common infirmity among the kings
of those ages. The Royal Rage of the proverb is one
of those subjects which the essayist enters in his notes
and never finds the time to treat. Then up spake Sir
Henry, with admonition in his voice: Did his Highness
of Cyprus really believe that the Lord Mayor,
a merchant adventurer of London, whose ships rode
at anchor in the Cyprian King's port of Famagusta,
should seek to win the money of him or of any other
king? "My Lord and King," he said, "be not aggrieved.
I court not your gold, but your play; for I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
have not bidden you hither that you might grieve."
And so gave the king his money back. But John,
King of France, and David, King of Scotland, and the
Black Prince murmured and whispered that it was not
fitting for a king to take back money lost at play.
And the good old King Edward stroked his gray
beard, but refrained from words.</p>

<p>Another entertainer of kings was Whittington.
What sayeth the wise man?</p>

<p>"Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He
shall stand before kings."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 462px;"><a name="GATEWAY_ETC_IN_CROSBY_SQUARE_NOW_DESTROYED" id="GATEWAY_ETC_IN_CROSBY_SQUARE_NOW_DESTROYED"></a>

<span class="caption">GATEWAY, ETC., IN CROSBY SQUARE (NOW DESTROYED)</span>
</div>

<p>They used to show an old house in Hart Lane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
rich with carved wood, as Whittington's, but he must
have lived in his own parish of St. Michael's Paternoster
Royal, and, one is pretty certain, on the spot
where was afterwards built his college, which stood on
the north side of the church. Here he entertained
Henry of Agincourt and Katherine, his bride, with a
magnificence which astonished the king. But Whittington
knew what he was doing; the banquet was
not ostentation and display; its cost was far more
than repaid by the respect for the wealth and power
of the city which it nourished and maintained in the
kingly mind. The memory of this and other such
feasts, we may be very sure, had its after effect even
upon those most masterful of sovereigns, Henry VIII.
and Queen Bess. On this occasion it was nothing
that the tables groaned with good things, and glittered
with gold and silver plate; it was nothing that the
fires were fed with cedar and perfumed wood. For
this princely Mayor fed these fires after dinner with
nothing less than the king's bonds to the amount of
£60,000. In purchasing power that sum would now
be represented by a million and a quarter.</p>

<p>A truly royal gift.</p>

<p>It was not given to many merchants, "sounding always
the increase of their winning," thus to thrive and
prosper. Most of them lived in more modest dwellings.
All of them lived in comparative discomfort, according
to modern ideas. When we read of mediæval
magnificence we must remember that the standard of
what we call comfort was much lower in most respects
than at present. In the matter of furniture, for instance,
though the house was splendid inside and out
with carvings, coats of arms painted and gilt, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
were but two or three beds in it, the servants sleeping
on the floor; the bedrooms were small and dark; the
tables were still laid on trestles, and removed when
the meal was finished; there were benches where we
have chairs; and for carpet they had rushes or mats of
plaited straw; and though the tapestry was costly,
the windows were draughty, and the doors ill-fitting.
When, with the great commercial advance of the fourteenth
century, space by the river became more valuable,
the disposition of the Hall, with its little court,
became necessarily modified. The house, which was
warehouse as well as residence, ran up into several
stories high&mdash;the earliest maps of London show many
such houses beside Queenhithe, and in the busiest and
most crowded parts of the City; on every story there
was a wide door for the reception of bales and crates;
a rope and pulley were fixed to a beam at the highest
gable for hoisting and lowering the goods. The front
of the house was finely ornamented with carved wood-work.
One may still see such houses&mdash;streets full of
them&mdash;in the ancient City of Hildesheim, near Hanover.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 476px;"><a name="CROSBY_HALL" id="CROSBY_HALL"></a>
<img src="images/page_183.jpg" width="476" height="622" alt="CROSBY HALL" title="" />
<span class="caption">CROSBY HALL</span>
</div>

<p>On the river-bank, exactly under what is now
Cannon Street Railway Station, stood the Steelyard,
Guildæ Aula Teutonicorum. In appearance it was a
house of stone, with a quay towards the river, a square
court, a noble Hall, and three arched gates towards
Thames Street. This was the house of the Hanseatic
League, whose merchants for three hundred years and
more enjoyed the monopoly of importing hemp, corn,
wax, steel, linen cloths, and, in fact, carried on the
whole trade with Germany and the Baltic, so that
until the London merchants pushed out their ships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
into the Mediterranean and the Levant their foreign
trade was small, and their power of gaining wealth
small in proportion. This strange privilege granted
to foreigners grew by degrees. At first, unless the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
foreign merchants of the Hanse towns and of Flanders
and of France had not brought over their wares they
could not have sold them, because there were no London
merchants to import them. Therefore they came,
and they came to stay. They gradually obtained
privileges; they were careful to obey the laws, and
give no cause for jealousy or offence; and they kept
their privileges, living apart in their own college, till
Edward VI. at last took them away. In memory of
their long residence in the city, the merchants of
Hamburg in the reign of Queen Anne presented the
church where they had worshipped, All Hallows the
Great, with a magnificent screen of carved wood. The
church, built by Wren after the Fire, is a square box
of no architectural pretensions, but is glorified by this
screen.</p>

<p>The great (comparative) wealth of the City is shown
by the proportion it was called upon to pay towards
the king's loans. In 1397, for instance, London was
assessed at £6,666 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, while Bristol, which came
next, was called upon for £800 only; Norwich for
£333, Boston for £300, and Plymouth for no more
than £20. And in the graduated poll tax of 1379,
the Lord Mayor of London had to pay £4&mdash;the same
as an Earl, a Bishop, or a mitred Abbot, while the
Aldermen were regarded as on the same line with
Barons, and paid £2 each.</p>

<p>Between the merchant adventurers, who sometimes
entertained kings and had a fleet of ships always on
the sea, and the retail trader there was as great a gulf
then as at any after-time. Between the retail trader,
who was an employer of labor, and the craftsman
there was a still greater gulf. The former lived in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
plenty and in comfort. His house was provided with
a spacious hearth, and windows, of which the upper
part, at least, was of glass. The latter lived in one of
the mean and low tenements, which, according to Dr.
Brewer, made up the whole of London. There were
a great many of those, because there are always a
great many poor in a large town. Nay, there were
narrow lanes and filthy courts where there were nothing
but one-storied hovels, built of wattle and clay,
the roof thatched with reeds, the fire burning in the
middle of the room, the occupants sleeping in old
Saxon fashion, wrapped in rugs around the central
fire. The lanes and courts were narrow and unpaved,
and filthy with every kind of refuse. In those crowded
and fetid streets the plague broke out, fevers always
lingered, the children died of putrid throat, and in
these places began the devastating fires that from
time to time swept the City.</p>

<p>The main streets of the City were not mean at all;
they were broad, well built, picturesque. If here and
there a small tenement reared its timbered and plastered
front among the tall gables, it added to the
beauty of the street; it broke the line. Take Chepe,
for instance, the principal seat of retail trade. At
the western end stood the Church of St. Michael le
Quern where Paternoster Row begins. On the north
side were the churches of St. Peter West Chepe, St.
Thomas Acon, St. Mary Cole Church, and St. Mildred.
On the south side were the churches of St. Mary
le Bow and St. Mary Woolchurch. In the streets running
north and south rose the spires of twenty other
churches. On the west side of St. Mary le Bow stood
a long stone gallery, from which the Queen and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
ladies could witness the tournaments and the ridings.
In the middle was the "Standard," with a conduit of
fresh-water; there were two crosses, one being that
erected by Edward I., to mark a resting-place of his
dead Queen. Round the "Standard" were booths.
At the west end of Chepe were <i>selds</i>, which are believed
to have been open bazaars for the sale of goods.
Another cross stood at the west end, close to St.
Michael le Quern. Here executions of citizens were
held; on its broad road the knights rode in tilt on
great days; the stalls were crowded with those who
came to look on and to buy, the street was noisy with
the voices of those who displayed their wares and called
upon the folk to buy&mdash;buy&mdash;buy. You may hear the
butchers in Clare Market or the costers in Whitecross
Street keeping up the custom to the present day.
The citizens walked and talked; the Alderman went
along in state, accompanied by his officers; they
brought out prisoners and put them into the pillory;
the church bells clashed, and chimed, and tolled;
bright cloth of scarlet hung from the upper windows
if it was a feast day, or if the Mayor and Aldermen
had a riding; the streets were bright with the colors
of that many-colored time, when the men vied with
the women in bravery of attire, and when all classes
spent upon raiment sums of money, in proportion to
the rest of their expenditure, which sober nineteenth-century
folk can hardly believe. Chaucer is
full of the extravagance in dress. There is the young
squire&mdash;</p>

were of rich silk; they carried thick gold chains
about their necks, and massive gold rings upon their
fingers.</p>

<p>With all this outward show, this magnificence of
raiment, these evidences of wealth, would one mark
the small tenements which here and there, even in
Chepe, stood between the churches and the substantial
merchants' houses? We measure the splendors
of a city by its best, and not by its worst.</p>

<p>The magnates of London, from generation to generation,
showed far more wisdom, tenacity, and clearness
of vision than can be found in the annals of Venice,
Genoa, or any other mediæval city. Above all
things, they maintained the city liberties and the
rights obtained from successive kings; yet they were
always loyal so long as loyalty was possible; when
that was no longer possible, as in the case of Richard
II., they threw the whole weight of their wealth and
influence into the other side. If fighting was wanted,
they were ready to send out their youths to fight&mdash;nay,
to join the army themselves; witness the story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
of Sir John Philpot, Mayor in 1378. There was a certain
Scottish adventurer named Mercer. This man
had gotten together a small fleet of ships, with which
he harassed the North Sea and did great havoc among
the English merchantmen. Nor could any remonstrance
addressed to the Crown effect any redress.
What was to be done? Clearly, if trade was to be carried
on at all, this enemy must be put down. Therefore,
without much ado, the gallant Mayor gathered
together at his own expense a company of a thousand
stout fellows, put them on board, and sallied forth,
himself their admiral, to fight this piratical Scot. He
found him, in fact, in Scarborough Bay with his prizes.
Sir John fell upon him at once, slew him and most of
his men, took all his ships, including the prizes, and
returned to the port of London with his spoils, including
fifteen Spanish ships which had joined the Scotchman.
Next year the king was in want of other help.
The arms and armor of a thousand men were in pawn.
Sir John took them out. And because the king wanted
as many ships as he could get for his expedition
into France, Sir John gave him all his own, with Mercer's
ships and the Spanish prizes.</p>

<p>To treat adequately of the foreign trade of the city
during these centuries would require a volume. It
has, in fact, received more than a single volume.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The
English merchantman sailed everywhere. There were
commercial treaties with Brittany, Burgundy, Portugal,
Castile, Genoa, and Venice. English merchants
who traded with Prussia were empowered by Henry
IV. to meet together and elect a governor for the adjustment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
of quarrels and the reparation of injuries.
The same privilege was extended to those who traded
with Holland, Zealand, Brabant, Flanders, Norway,
Sweden, and Denmark. The Hanseatic merchants enjoyed
the privileges on the condition&mdash;not always
obtained&mdash;that English merchants should have the
same rights as the Hanseatic League. It is easy to understand
what commodities were imported from these
countries. The trade was carried on under the conditions
of continued fighting. First the seas swarmed
with Scotch; French and Flemish ships were always
on the lookout for English merchant vessels&mdash;there
was no peace on the water. Then there were English
pirates known as rovers of the sea, who sailed about,
landing on the coasts, pillaging small towns, and robbing
farms. Sandwich was burned, Southampton was
burned. London protected herself with booms and
chains. The merchant vessels for safety sailed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
fleets. Again, it was sometimes dangerous to be resident
in a foreign town in time of war; in 1429 Bergen
was destroyed by the Danes, and the English merchants
were massacred; about the same time English
seamen ravaged Ireland and murdered the Royal Bailiff;
reprisals and quarrels and claims were constantly
going on. Yet trade increased, and wealth with it.
Other foreign merchants settled in London besides
the Hansards. Florentines came to buy wool, and to
lend money, and to sell chains and rings and jewelled
work. Genoese came to buy alum and woad and to
sell weapons. Venetians came to sell spices, drugs,
and fine manufactured things.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the fourteenth century began
the first grumblings of the great religious storm that
was to burst upon the world a hundred years later.
The common sort of Londoners, attached to their
Church and to its services, were as yet profoundly orthodox
and unquestioning. But it is certain that in
the year 1393 the Archbishop of York complained formally
to the king of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs&mdash;Whittington
was then one of the Sheriffs&mdash;that
they were <i>male creduli</i>, that is, of little faith; upholders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
of Lollards, detractors of religious persons, detainers
of tithes, and defrauders of the poor. When persecutions,
however, began in earnest, not a single
citizen of position was charged with heresy. Probably
the Archbishop's charge was based upon some
quarrel over tithes and Church dues. At the same
time, no one who has read Chaucer can fail to understand
that men's minds were made uneasy by the
scandals of religion, the contrast between profession
and practice. It required no knowledge of theology
to remark that the monk who kept the best of horses
in his stable and the best of hounds in his kennel, and
rode to the chase as gallantly attired as any young
knight, was a strange follower of the Benedictine rule.
Nor was it necessary to be a divine in order to compare
the lives of the Franciscans with their vows.
Yet the authority of the Church seemed undiminished,
while its wealth, its estates, its rank, and its privileges
gave it enormous power. It is not pretended that
the merchants of London were desirous of new doctrines,
or of any tampering with the mass, or any lowering
of sacerdotal pretensions. Yet there can be no
doubt that they desired reform in some shape, and it
seems as if they saw the best hope of reform in raising
the standard of education. Probably the old
monastery schools had fallen into decay. We find,
for instance, a simultaneous movement in this direction
long before Henry VI. began to found and to
endow his schools. Whittington bequeathed a sum
of money to create a library for the Grey Friars; his
close friend and one of his executors, John Carpenter,
Rector of St. Mary Magdalen, founded the City of
London School, now more flourishing and of greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
use than ever; another friend of Whittington, Sir
John Nicol, Master of the College of St. Thomas
Acon, petitioned the Parliament for leave to establish
four schools; Whittington's own company, the Mercers,
founded a school&mdash;which still exists&mdash;upon his
death. The merchants rebuilt churches, bought advowsons
and gave them to the corporation, founded
charities, and left doctrine to scholars. Yet the century
which contains such men as Wycliff, Chaucer,
Gower, Occleve, William of Wykeham, Fabian, and
others, was not altogether one of blind and unquestioning
obedience. And it is worthy of remark that
the first Master of Whittington's Hospital was that
Reginald Pecock who afterwards, as Bishop of Chichester,
was charged with Lollardism, and imprisoned
for life as a punishment. He was kept in a single
closed chamber in Thorney Abbey, Isle of Ely. He
was never allowed out of this room; no one was to
speak with him except the man who waited upon him;
he was to have neither paper, pen, ink, or books, except
a Bible, a mass-book, a psalter, and a legendary.</p>

<p>Among the city worthies of that time may be introduced
Sir William Walworth, the slayer of Jack
Cade; Sir William Sevenoke, the first known instance
of the poor country lad of humble birth working his
way to the front; he was also the first to found and
endow a grammar-school for his native town; Sir Robert
Chichele, whose brother Henry was Archbishop
of Canterbury and founder of All Souls', Oxford; this
Robert, whose house was on the site of Bakers' Hall
in Harp Lane, provided by his will that on his commemoration
day two thousand four hundred poor
householders of the city should be regaled with a dinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
and have twopence in money; Sir John Rainwell,
who left houses and lands to discharge the tax called
the Fifteenth in three parishes; Sir John Wells, who
brought water from Tyburn; and Sir William Estfield,
who brought water from Highbury. Other examples
show that the time for endowing monasteries
had passed away. When William Elsing, early in the
fourteenth century, thought of doing something with
his money, he did
not leave it to
the Franciscans
for masses, but he
endowed a hospital
for a hundred
blind men; and
a few years later
John Barnes gave
the city a strong
box with three
locks, containing
a thousand marks,
which were to be
lent to young
men beginning
business&mdash;an excellent gift. When there was a great
dearth of grain, it was the Lord Mayor who fitted
out ships at his own expense and brought corn from
Prussia, which lowered the price of flour by one-half.
In the acts of these grave magistrates one can
read the deep love they bore to the City, their earnest
striving for the administration with justice of
just laws, for the maintenance of good work, for the
relief of the poor, for the provision of water, and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
education. Lollardism was nothing to them. What
concerned them in religion was the luxury, the sloth,
and the scandalous lives of the religious. Order they
loved, because it is only by the maintenance of order
that a city can flourish. Honesty in work of all kinds
they loved, so that while they hated the man who
pretended to do true work and proffered false work,
it grieved and shamed them to see one who professed
the life of purity wallow in wickedness, like a hog in
mud. Obedience they required, because without obedience
there is no government. As for the working-man,
the producer, the servant, having any share in
the profits or any claim to payment beyond his wage,
such a thought never entered the head of Whittington
or Sevenoke. They were rulers; they were masters;
they paid the wage; they laid their hands upon
the profits.</p>

<p>Tradition&mdash;which is always on the side of the weak&mdash;maintains
that the great merchants of the past, for
the most part, made their way upward from the poorest
and most penniless conditions. They came from
the plough-tail or from the mechanic's shop; they entered
the city paved with gold, friendless, with no
more than twopence, if so much, in their pockets;
they received scant favor and put up with rough fare.
Then tradition makes a jump, and shows them, on
the next lifting of the curtain, prosperous, rich, and in
great honor. The typical London merchant is Dick
Whittington, whose history was blazoned in the cheap
books for all to read. One is loath to disturb venerable
beliefs, but the facts of history are exactly the
opposite. The merchant adventurer, diligent in his
business, and therefore rewarded, as the wise man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
prophesied for him, by standing before princes, though
he began life as a prentice, also began it as a gentleman.
He belonged, at the outset, to a good family,
and had good friends both in the country and the
town. Piers Plowman never could and never did rise
to great eminence in the city. The exceptions, which
are few indeed, prove the rule. Against such a case
as Sevenoke, the son of poor parents, who rose to be
Lord Mayor, we have a hundred others in which the
successful merchant starts with the advantage of gentle
birth. Take, for example, the case of Whittington
himself.</p>

<p>He was the younger son of a Gloucestershire country
gentleman, Sir William Whittington, a knight who
was outlawed for some offence. His estate was at a
village called Pauntley. In the church may still be
seen the shield of Whittington impaling Fitzwarren&mdash;Richard's
wife was Alice Fitzwarren. His mother
belonged to the well-known Devonshire family of
Mansell, and was a cousin of the Fitzwarrens. The
Whittingtons were thus people of position and consideration,
of knightly rank, <i>armigeri</i>, living on their
own estates, which were sufficient but not large.</p>

<p>For a younger son in the fourteenth century the
choice of a career was limited. He might enter the
service of a great lord and follow his fortunes. In
that turbulent time there was fighting to be had at
home as well as in France, and honor to be acquired,
with rank and lands, by those who were fortunate.
He might join the livery of the king. He might
enter the Church: but youths of gentle blood did not
in the fourteenth century flock readily to the Church.
He might remain on the family estate and become a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
bailiff. He might go up to London and become a
lawyer. There were none of the modern professions&mdash;no
engineers, architects, bankers, journalists, painters,
novelists, or dramatists; but there was trade.</p>

<p>Young Dick Whittington therefore chose to follow
trade; rather that line of life was chosen for him. He
was sent to London under charge of carriers, and
placed in the house of his cousin, Sir John Fitzwarren,
also a gentleman before he was a merchant, as an apprentice.
As he married his master's daughter, it is
reasonable to suppose that he inherited a business,
which he subsequently improved and developed enormously.
If we suppose a single man to be the owner
of the Cunard Line of steamers, running the cargoes
on his own venture and for his own profit, we may
understand something of Whittington's position in
the city. The story of the cat is persistently attached
to his name; it begins immediately after his
death; it was figured on the buildings which his executors
erected; it formed part of the decorations of
the family mansion at Gloucester. It is therefore impossible
to avoid the conclusion that he did himself
associate the sale of a cat&mdash;then a creature of some
value and rarity&mdash;with the foundation of his fortunes.
Here, however, we have only to do with the fact that
Whittington was of gentle birth, and that he was apprenticed
to a man also of gentle birth.</p>

<span class="caption">ANCIENT COURT OF BRIDEWELL PALACE</span>
</div>

<p>Here, again, is another proof of my assertion that
the London merchant was generally a gentleman.
That good old antiquary, Stow, to whom we owe so
much, not only gives an account of all the monuments
in the city churches, with the inscriptions and verses
which were graven upon them, but he also describes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
the shields of all those who were <i>armigeri</i>&mdash;entitled to
carry arms. Remember that a shield was not a thing
which could in those days be assumed at pleasure.
The Heralds made visitations of the counties, and examined
into the pretensions of every man who bore a
coat of arms. You were either entitled to a coat of
arms or you were not. To parade a shield without a
proper title was much as if a man should in these
days pretend to be an Earl or a Baronet. If one
wants a shield it is only necessary now to invent one;
or the Heralds' College will with great readiness connect
a man with some knightly family and so confer
a title: formerly the Herald could only invent or find
a coat of arms by order of the Sovereign, the Fountain
of Honor. By granting a shield, let us remember,
the king admitted another family into the first rank
of gentlehood. For instance, when the news of Captain
Cook's death reached England, King George III.
granted a coat of arms to his family, who were thereby
promoted to the first stage of nobility. This,
however, seems to have been the last occasion of such
a grant.</p>

<p>What do we find, then? This very remarkable
fact. The churches are full of monuments to dead
citizens who are <i>armigeri</i>. Take two churches at
hazard. The first is St. Leonard's, Milk Street. Here
were buried, among others, John Johnson, citizen and
butcher, died 1282, his coat of arms displayed upon
his tomb; also, with his family shield, Richard Ruyener,
citizen and fish-monger, died 1361. The second
church is St. Peter's, Cornhill. Here the following
monuments have their shields: that of Thomas Lorimer,
citizen and mercer; of Thomas Born, citizen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
draper; of Henry Acle, citizen and grocer; of Henry
Palmer, citizen and <i>pannarius</i>; of Henry Aubertner,
citizen and tailor; and of Timothy Westrow, citizen
and grocer. In short, I do not say that the retail
traders were of knightly family, but that the great
merchants, the mercers, adventurers, and leaders of
the Companies were gentlemen by descent, and admitted
to their close society only their own friends,
cousins, and sons.</p>

<p>The residence and yearly influx of the Barons and
their followers into London not only, as we have seen,
kept the city in touch with the country, and prevented
it from becoming a mere centre of trade, but
it also kept the country in touch with the City. The
livery of the great Lords compared their own lot, at
best an honorable servitude, with that of the free and
independent merchants who had no over-lord but the
King, and were themselves as rich as any of the
greatest Barons in the country. They saw among
them many from their own country, lads whom they
remembered in the hunting-field, or playing in the
garden before the timbered old house in the country,
of gentle birth and breeding; once, like themselves,
poor younger sons, now rich and of great respect.
When they went home they talked of this, and fired
the blood of the boys, so that while some stayed at
home and some put on the livery of a Baron, others
went up to London and served their time. So that,
when we assign a city origin to the families of Coventry,
Leigh, Ducie, Pole, Bouverie, Boleyn, Legge,
Capel, Osborne, Craven, and Ward, it would be well
to inquire, if possible, to what stock belonged the
original citizen, the founder of each. Trade in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
fourteenth century, and long afterwards, did not degrade
a gentleman. That idea was of an earlier and
of a later date. It became a law during the last century,
when the county families began to grow rich
and the value of land increased. It is fast disappearing
again, and the city is once more receiving the
sons of noble and gentle. The change should be
welcomed as helping to destroy the German notions
of caste and class and the hereditary superiority of
the ennobled House.</p>

<p>As for the political power of London under the
Plantagenets, it will be sufficient to refer to Froissart.
"The English," says the chronicler, unkindly, "are the
worst people in the world, the most obstinate, and the
most presumptuous, and of all England the Londoners
are the leaders; for, to say the truth, they are
very powerful in men and in wealth. In the city and
neighborhood there are 25,000 men, completely armed
from head to foot, and full 30,000 archers. This is a
great force, and they are bold and courageous, and the
more blood is spilled the greater is their courage."
The deposition of King Edward II. and that of King
Richard II. illustrate at once the "presumption and
obstinacy" and the power of the citizens. Later on,
the depositions of Charles I. and of James II. were
also largely assisted by these presumptuous citizens.</p>

<p>The first case, that of Edward II., is thus summed
up by Froissart:</p>

<blockquote><p>When the Londoners perceived King Edward so besotted
with the Despencers, they provided a remedy, by sending secretly
to Queen Isabella information, that if she would collect
a body of 300 armed men, and land with them in England, she
would find the citizens of London and the majority of the nobles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
and commonalty ready to join her and place her on the
throne. The Queen found a friend in Sir John of Hainault,
Lord of Beaumont and Chimay, and brother to Count William
of Hainault, who undertook, through affection and pity, to carry
her and her son back to England. He exerted himself so
much in her service with knights and squires, that he collected
a body of 400 and landed them in England, to the great comfort
of the Londoners. The citizens joined them, for, without
their assistance, they would never have accomplished the enterprise.
King Edward was made prisoner at Bristol, and carried
to Berkeley Castle, where he died. His advisers were all
put to death with much cruelty, and the same day King Edward
III. was crowned King of England in the Palace of Westminster.</p></blockquote>

<p>When, in the case of Richard II., the time of expostulation
had passed, and that for armed resistance
or passive submission had arrived, the Londoners remembered
their action in the reign of Edward II.,
and perceived that if they did not move they would
be all ruined and destroyed. They therefore resolved
upon bringing over from France, Henry, Earl of Derby,
and entreated the Archbishop of Canterbury to
go over secretly and invite him, promising the whole
strength of London for his service. As we know,
Henry accepted and came over. On his landing he
sent a special messenger to ride post haste to London
with the news. The journey was performed in less
than twenty-four hours. The Lord Mayor sent the
news about in all directions, and the Londoners prepared
to give their future king a right joyous welcome.
They poured out along the roads to meet him, and all
men, women, and children clad in their best clothes.
"The Mayor of London rode by the side of the Earl,
and said, 'See, my Lord, how much the people are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
rejoiced at your arrival.' As the Earl advanced, he
bowed his head to the right and left, and noticed all
comers with kindness.... The whole town was so rejoiced
at the Earl's return that every shop was shut
and no more work done than if it had been Easter Day."</p>

<p>The army which Henry led to the west was an
army of Londoners, twelve thousand strong. It was
to the Tower of London that the fallen King was
brought; and it was in the Guildhall that the articles
drawn up against the King were publicly read; and it
was in Cheapside that the four knights, Richard's
principal advisers, were beheaded. At the Coronation
feast the King sat at the first table, having with him
the two archbishops and seventeen bishops. At the
second table sat the five great peers of England. At
the third were the principal citizens of London; below
them sat the knights. The place assigned to the
city is significant. But London had not yet done
enough for Henry of Lancaster. The Earls of Huntingdon
and Salisbury attempted a rebellion against
him. Said the Mayor, "Sire, we have made you king,
and king you shall be." And King he remained.</p>

<p>It was in this fourteenth century that the city experienced
the most important change in the whole
history of her constitution, more important than the
substitution of the Mayor and Aldermen for the port-reeve
and sheriff, though that was nothing less than
the passage from the feudal county to the civic community.
The new thing was the formation of the
city companies, which incorporated each trade formally,
and gave the fullest powers to the governing body
over wages, hours of labor, output, and everything
which concerned the welfare of each craft.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span></p>

<p>There had been many attempts made at combination.
Men at all times have been sensible of the advantages
of combining; at all times and in every trade
there is the same difficulty, that of persuading everybody
to forego an apparent present advantage for a
certain benefit in the future; there are always black-legs,
yet the cause of combination advances.</p>

<p>The history of the city companies is that of combination
so successfully carried out that it became part
of the constitution and government of the city; but,
which was not foreseen at the outset, combination in
the interests of the masters, not of the men.</p>

<p>The trades had long formed associations which they
called guilds. These, for some appearance of independence,
began to arouse suspicion. Kings have
never regarded any combination of their subjects with
approbation. The guilds were ostensibly religious;
they had each a patron saint&mdash;St. Martin, for instance,
protected the saddlers; St. Anthony, the grocers&mdash;and
they held an annual festival on their saint's day.
But they must be licensed; eighteen such guilds were
fined for establishing themselves without a license.
Those which were licensed paid for the privilege.
The most important of them was the Guild of Weavers,
which was authorized by Henry II. to regulate
the trades of cloth-workers, drapers, tailors, and all
the various crafts and "mysteries" that belong to
clothes. This guild became so powerful that it threatened
to rival in authority the governing body. It
was therefore suppressed by King John, the different
trades afterwards combining separately to form their
own companies.</p>

<p>We are not writing a history of London, otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
the rise and growth of the City companies would form
a most interesting chapter. It has been done in a
brief and convenient form by Loftie, in his little book
on London (<i>Historic Towns Series</i>). Very curious and
suggestive reading it is. At the period with which
we are now concerned, the end of the fourteenth century,
the companies were rapidly forming and presenting
regulations for the approval and license of the
Mayor and Aldermen. By the year 1363 there were
thirty-two companies already formed whose laws and
regulations had received the approbation of the King.
Let us take those of the Company of Glovers. They
are briefly as follows:</p>

<p>(1) None but a freeman of the City shall make or
sell gloves.</p>

<p>(2) No glover shall be admitted to the freedom of
the City unless with the assent of the Wardens of the
trade.</p>

<p>(3) No one shall entice away the servant of another.</p>

<p>(4) If a servant in the trade shall make away with
his master's chattels to the value of twelvepence, the
Wardens shall make good the loss; and if the servant
refuse to be adjudged upon by the Wardens, he shall
be taken before the Mayor and Aldermen.</p>

<p>(5) No one shall sell his goods by candlelight.</p>

<p>(6) Any false work found shall be taken before the
Mayor and Aldermen by the Wardens.</p>

<p>(7) All things touching the trade within the City between
those who are not freemen shall be forfeited.</p>

<p>(8) Journeymen shall be paid their present rate of
wages.</p>

<p>(9) Persons who entice away journeymen glovers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
make gloves in their own houses shall be brought before
the Mayor and Aldermen.</p>

<p>(10) Any one of the trade who refuses to obey these
regulations shall be brought before the Mayor and
Aldermen.</p>

<p>Observe, upon these laws, first, that the fourth simply
transfers the master's right to chastise his servant
to the governing body of the company. This seems
to put the craftsmen in a better position. Here, apparently,
is combination carried to the fullest. All
the glovers in the City unite; no one shall make or
sell gloves except their own members; the company
shall order the rate of wages and the admission of apprentices;
no glover shall work for private persons, or
for any one, except by order of the company. Here
is absolute protection of trade and absolute command
of trade. Unfortunately, the Wardens and court were
not the craftsmen, but the masters. Therefore the
regulations of trade were very quickly found to serve
the enrichment of the masters and the repression of
the craftsmen. And if the latter formed "covins"
or conspiracies for the improvement of wages, they
very soon found out that such associations were put
down with the firmest hand. To be brought before
the Mayor and Aldermen meant, unless submission
was made and accepted, expulsion from the City. So
long as the conditions of the time allowed, the companies
created a Paradise for the master. The workman
was suppressed; he could not combine; he could
not live except on the terms imposed by his company:
if he rebelled he was thrust out of the City
gates. The jurisdiction of the City, however, ceased
at the walls; when a greater London began to grow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
outside Cripplegate, Bishopsgate, and Aldgate, and
on the reclaimed marshes of Westminster and along
the river-bank, craftsmen not of any company could
settle down and work as they please. But they had
to find a market, which might be impossible except
within the City, where they were not admitted. Therefore
the companies, as active guardians and jealous
promoters of their trades, fulfilled their original purposes
a long while, and enabled many generations of
masters to grow rich upon the work of their servants.</p>

<p>Every company was governed by its Wardens. The
Warden had great powers; he proved the quality,
weight, or length of the goods exposed for sale; the
members were bound to obey the Warden; to prevent
bad blood, every man called upon to serve his
time as Warden had to undertake the office. The
Warden also looked after the poor of the craft, assisted
the old and infirm, the widows and the orphans.
He had also to watch over the fraternity, to take care
that there should be no underselling, no infringement
of the rate of wage, no overreaching of one by the
other. He was, in short, to maintain the common interest
of the trade. It was a despotism, but, on the
whole, a benevolent despotism. The Englishman was
not yet ready for popular rule; doubtless the jealousies
of the sovereign were allayed by the discovery that
the association of a trade was a potent engine for the
maintenance of order and the repression of the turbulent
craftsman. How turbulent they could be was
proved by the troubles which arose in the reign of
Henry III.</p>

<p>The great companies were always separate and distinct
from the smaller companies. For a long time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
the Mayor was exclusively elected from the former.
Even at the present day, unless the Mayor belongs to
one of the great companies, he labors under certain
disadvantages. He cannot, for instance, become President
of the Irish Society.</p>

<p>By the end of the fourteenth century, then&mdash;to sum
up&mdash;the government of London was practically complete
and almost in its present form. The Mayor, become
an officer of the highest importance, was elected
every year; the Sheriffs every year; the Aldermen
and the Common Councilmen were elected by wards.
The Mayor was chosen from the great companies,
which comprised all the merchant venturers, importers,
exporters, men who had correspondence over the
seas, masters, and employers. Every craft had its own
regulations; no one could trade in the City who did
not belong to a company; no one could work in the
City, or even make anything to be sold, who did not
belong to a company. Wages were ordered by the
companies; working-men had no appeal from the
ruling of the Warden. From time to time there were
attempts made by the craftsmen to make combinations
for themselves. These attempts were sternly
and swiftly put down. No trades-unions were suffered
to be formed; nay, even within the memory of
living man trades-unions were treated as illegal associations.
The craftsman, as a political factor, disappears
from history with the creation of the companies.
In earlier times we hear his voice in the folkmote;
we see him tossing his cap and shouting for William
Longbeard. But when Whittington sits on the Lord
Mayor's chair he is silenced. And he remains silent
until, by a renewal of those covins and conspiracies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
which Whittington put down so sternly, he has become
a greater power in the land than ever he was
before. Even yet, however, and with all the lessons
that he has learned, his power of combination is imperfect,
his aims are narrow, and his grasp of his own
power is feeble and restricted.</p>

<p>For my own part, I confess that this repression, this
silencing of the craftsman in the fourteenth century,
seems to me to have been necessary for the growth
and prosperity of the City. For the craftsman was
then incredibly ignorant; he knew nothing except
his own craft; as for his country, the conditions of
the time, the outer world, he knew nothing at all;
he might talk to the sailors who lay about the quays
between voyages, but they could tell him nothing
that would help him in his trade; he could not read,
he could not inquire, because he knew not what question
to ask or what information he wanted; he had
no principles; he was naturally ready, for his own
present advantages, to sacrifice the whole world; he
believed all he was told. Had the London working-man
acquired such a share in the government of his
city as he now has in the government of his country,
the result would have been a battle-field of discordant
and ever-varying factions, ruled and led each in turn
by a short-lived demagogue.</p>

<p>It was, in short, a most happy circumstance for
London that the government of the City fell into the
hands of an oligarchy, and still more happy that the
oligarchs themselves were under the rule of a jealous
and a watchful sovereign.</p>

<p>So far it was well. It would have been better had
the governing body recognized the law that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
must be always enlarging their borders. Then they
would have begun in earnest the education of the
people. We, who have only taken this work in hand
for twenty years, may not throw stones. The voice
of the educated craftsman should have been heard
long ago. Then we might have been spared many
oppressions, many foolish wars, many cruelties. But
from the fourteenth to the nineteenth century the
craftsman is silent. Nay, in every generation he
grows more silent, less able to say what he wants;
more inarticulate, more angry and discontented, and
more powerless to make his wants heard until he
reaches the lowest depth ever arrived at by Englishmen;
and that, I think, was about a hundred years
ago.</p>

<p>Through broad Chepeside rode the great lord&mdash;haply
the King himself&mdash;followed by his regiment
of knights, gentlemen, and men-at-arms, all wearing
his livery. The Abbot, with his following, passed
along on his way to Westminster in stately procession.
The Alderman, in fur gown and gold chain,
with his officers, walked through the market inspecting
weights and measures and the goods exposed for
sale. Priests and friars crowded the narrow ways.
To north and south, in sheds which served for shops,
the prentices stood bawling their wares. This was
the outward and visible side of the City. There was
another side&mdash;the City of the London craftsman.</p>

<span class="caption">OLD CHARING CROSS</span>
</div>

<p>Who was he&mdash;the craftsman? Whence did he
come? London has always opened her hospitable
arms to foreigners. They still come to the City and
settle, enjoying its freedom, and in the next generation
are pure English. In the days of Edward the
Confessor the men of Rouen and of Flanders became
citizens with rights equal to the English. Later on,
the names of the people show their origin and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
places whence they or their forefathers had come.
Then William Waleys is William the Welchman;
Walter Norris is Walter of Norway; John Francis is
John the Frenchman; Henry Upton is Henry of that
town; William Sevenoke, Lord Mayor of London,
took his name from the village
of Sevenoaks, in Kent, where
he was born. The first surnames
were bestowed not only
with reference to the place of
birth, but partly to trades, partly
to the place of residence,
partly to personal defects or
peculiarities. But it is obvious
from the earliest names on record
how readily London received
strangers from any quarter
of western Europe, Norway,
Denmark, Flanders, Lorraine,
Picardy, Normandy, Guyenne,
Spain, Provence, and Italy. It
is noteworthy in studying the
names, first, that, as was to be
expected, there is not in the fourteenth century a
single trace of British or Roman-British name, either
Christian or surname, just as there was not in the
Saxon occupation a single trace of Roman customs
or institutions; next, that the Saxon names have all
vanished. There are no longer any Wilfreds, Ælfgars,
Eadberhts, Sigeberts, Harolds, or Eadgars among
the Christian names. They have given place to the
Norman names of John, Henry, William, and the like.
The London craftsman was therefore a compound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
many races. The dominant strain was Saxon&mdash;East
Saxon; then came Norman, then Fleming, and then a
slight infusion of every nation of Western Europe.</p>

<p>In the narrow lanes leading north and south of the
two great streets of Thames and Chepe the craftsmen
of London lived in their tenements, each consisting of
a room below and a room above. Some of them followed
their trade at home, some worked in shops.
There were those who sold and those who made. Of
the former, the mercers and haberdashers kept their
shops in West Chepe; the goldsmiths in Guthrun's
Lane and Old Change; the pepperers and grocers in
Soper's Lane; the drapers in Lombard Street and
Cornhill; the skinners in St. Mary Axe; the fish-mongers
in Thames Street; the iron-mongers in Ironmongers'
Lane and Old Jewry; the vintners in the
Vintry; the butchers in East Chepe, St. Nicolas
Shambles, and the Stocks Market; the hosiers in
Hosiers' Lane; the shoemakers and curriers in Cordwainer
Street; the paternoster-sellers in Paternoster
Row; patten-sellers by St. Margaret Pattens; and so
forth.</p>

<p>It is easy, with the help of Stow, and with the
names of the streets before one, to map out the chief
market-places and the shops. It is not so easy to lay
down the places where those dwelt who carried on
handicrafts. Stow indicates here and there a few
facts. The Founders of candlesticks, chafing-dishes,
and spice mortars carried on their work in Lothbury;
the coal-men and wood-mongers were found about
Billingsgate stairs; since the Flemish weavers met in
the church-yard of Lawrence Pountney, they lived
presumably in that parish. For the same reason the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
Brabant weavers probably lived in St. Mary Somerset
parish. The furriers worked in Walbrook; the curriers
opposite London Wall; upholsterers or undertakers
on Cornhill; cutlers worked in Pope's Head
Alley; basket-makers, wire-drawers, and "other foreigners"
in Blond Chapel, or Blanch Appletone Lane.
In Mincing Lane dwelt the men of Genoa and other
parts who brought wine to the port of London in their
galleys. The turners of beads for prayers lived in Paternoster
Row; the bowyers in Bowyer Row; other
crafts there are which may be assigned to their original
streets. Sometimes, but not always, the site of a
company's hall marks the quarter chiefly inhabited
by that trade. Certainly the vintners belonged to the
Vintry, where is now their hall, and the weavers to
Chepe, where they still have their hall. When, however,
the management of a trade or craft passed into
the hands of a company, there was no longer any reason,
except where men had to work together, why
they should live together. Since there could be no
combined action by the men, but, on the contrary,
blind obedience to the Warden, they might as well
live in whatever part of the City should be the most
convenient. From the absence of great houses, whether
of nobles or princes, in the north of the City, one is
inclined to believe that great numbers of craftsmen
lived in that part, namely, between what is now called
Gresham Street and London Wall.</p>

<p>The trades carried on within the walls covered very
nearly the whole field of manufacture. A mediæval
city made everything that it wanted&mdash;wine, spices,
silks, velvets, precious stones, and a few other things
excepted, which were brought to the port from abroad;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
but the City could get on very well without those
things. Within the walls they made everything. It
is not until one reads the long lists of trades collected
together by Riley that one understands how many
things were wanted, and how trades were subdivided.
Clothing in its various branches gave work to the
wympler, who made wimples or neckerchiefs for women;
the retunder, or shearman of cloth; the batour,
or worker of cloth; the caplet-monger; the callere,
who made cauls or coifs for the head; the quilter; the
pinner; the chaloner, who made chalons or coverlets;
the bureller, who worked in burel, a coarse cloth; the
tailor; the linen armorer; the chaucer, or shoemaker;
the plumer, or feather-worker; the pelliper, pellercer,
or furrier; the white tawyer, who made white leather;
and many others. Arms and armor wanted the bowyer;
the kissere, who made armor for the thighs; the
bokelsmyth, who make bucklers; the bracere, who
made armor for arms; the gorgiarius, who made gorgets;
the taborer, who made drums; the heaulmere,
who made helmets; the makers of haketons, pikes,
swords, spears, and bolts for crossbows. Trades were
thus already divided; we see one man making one
thing and nothing else all his life. The equyler made
porringers, the brochere made spits, the haltier made
halters, the corder made ropes, the sacker made sacks,
the melmallere made hammers, and so on.</p>

<p>The old City grows gradually clearer to the vision
when we think of all these trades carried on within
the walls. There were mills to grind the corn; breweries
for making the beer&mdash;one remains in the City
still; the linen was spun within the walls, and the
cloth made and dressed; the brass pots, tin pots, iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
utensils, and wooden platters and basins were all made
in the City; the armor, with its various pieces, was
hammered out and fashioned in the streets; all kinds
of clothes, from the leathern jerkin of the poorest to
the embroidered robes of a princess, were made here;
nothing that was wanted for household use in the
country but was made in London town. Some of
those trades were offensive to their neighbors. Under
Edward I., for instance, the melters of tallow and lard
were made to leave Chepe, and to find a more convenient
place at a distance from that fashionable
street. The names of Stinking Lane, Scalding Lane,
and Sheer Hog sufficiently indicate the pleasing effect
of the things done in them upon the neighbors. The
modern City of London&mdash;the City proper&mdash;is a place
where they make nothing, but sell everything. It is
now quite a quiet city; the old rumbling of broad-wheeled
wagons over a stone-laid roadway has given
way to the roll of the narrow wheel over the smooth
asphalt; the craftsmen have left the City. But in the
days of Whittington there was no noisier city in the
whole world; the roar and the racket of it could be
heard afar off&mdash;even at the rising of the Surrey Hills
or the slope of Highgate, or the top of Parliament
Hill. Every man in the City was at work except the
lazy men-at-arms of my lord's following in the great
house that was like a barrack. They lay about waiting
for the order to mount and ride off to the border,
or the Welsh march, or to fight the French. But
roundabout these barracks the busy craftsmen worked
all day long. From every lane rang out without ceasing
the tuneful note of the hammer and the anvil;
the carpenters, not without noise, drove in their nails,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
and the coopers hooped their casks; the blacksmith's
fire roared; the harsh grating of the founders set the
teeth on edge of those who passed that way; along
the river-bank, from the Tower to Paul's stairs, those
who loaded and those who unloaded, those who carried
the bales to the warehouses, those who hoisted
them up, the ships which came to port and the ships
which sailed away, did all with fierce talking, shouting,
quarrelling, and racket. Such work must needs be
carried on with noise. The pack-horses plodded along
the streets, coming into the City and going out. Wagons
with broad wheels rumbled and groaned along;
the prentices bawled from the shops; the fighting-men
marched along to sound of trumpet; the church
bells and the monastery bells rang out all day long,
and all night too. And at the doors of the houses or
the open windows, where there was no glass, but a
hanging shutter, sat or stood the women, preparing
the food, washing, mending, sewing, or spinning, their
children playing in the street before them. There are
many towns of France, especially Southern France,
which recall the mediæval city. Here the women live
and do their work in the door-ways; the men work at
the open windows; and all day there is wafted along
the streets and up to the skies the fragrance of soup
and onions, roasted meats and baked confections, with
the smell of every trade which the people carry on.</p>

<p>Everything was made within the walls of the City.
When one thinks upon the melting of tallow, the boiling
of soap, the crushing of bones, the extracting of
glue, the treatment of feathers and cloth and leather,
the making and grinding of knives and all other sharp
weapons, the crowding of the slaughter-houses, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
decaying of fruit and vegetables, the roasting of meat
at cooks' shops, the baking of bread, the brewing of
beer, the making of vinegar, and all the thousand and
one things which go to make up the life of a town,
the most offensive of which are now carried on without
the town; when one considers, further, the gutter,
which played so great a part in every mediæval
city; the gutter stream, which was almost Sabbatical,
because it ceased to run when people ceased to work;
the brook of the middle of the street, flowing with
suds, the water used for domestic and for trade purposes,
and with everything that would float or flow;
when, again, one thinks of the rags and bones, the
broken bits and remnants and fragments, the cabbage-stalks
and pea-pods and onion-peelings which were
thrown into the street, though against the law, and of
the lay stalls, where filth and refuse of every kind
were thrown to wait the coming of carts, even more
uncertain than those of a modern vestry&mdash;when, I
say, one thinks of all these things, and of the small
boundaries of the City, and its crowded people, and
of its narrow streets, one understands how there
hung over the City day and night, never quite blown
away even by the most terrible storm that ever
wept o'er pale Britannia, a richly confected cloud of
thick and heavy smell which the people had to
breathe.</p>

<p>They liked it; without it, the true Londoner languished.
The mediæval smell, the smell of great
towns, has left London, but in old towns of the Continent,
as in the old streets of Brussels, it meets and
greets us to the present day. Breathing this air with
difficulty, and perhaps with nausea, you may say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
"Such and such was the air in which the citizens of
London delighted when Edward III. was King."</p>

<p>The craftsman in those days had to do good work,
or he would hear of it. He had to obey his company,
or he would hear of it; and he had to take, with outward
show of contentment, the wages that were assigned
to him, or he would hear of it. He might be
imprisoned, or put in pillory. We shall see a few
cases of his punishment presently. As a final punishment
he might be thrust outside the gates of the City,
and told to go away and to return no more.</p>

<p>Then, one fears, there would be nothing left for the
craftsman but to turn <i>ribaud</i>, if he was clever enough
to learn the arts of <i>ribauderie</i>; or to sink into the
lowest depth and become a <i>villein</i>, bound to the soil.</p>

<p>If it was a city of hard work, it was also a city of
play in plenty. London citizens, old and young, have
always delighted beyond measure in games, shows,
sports, and amusements of every kind. There were
many holidays, and Sunday was not a day of gloom.</p>

<p>The calendar of sport begins with the first day of
the year, and ends with the last day.</p>

<p>The year began with New-year's gifts:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">These giftes the husband gives his wife and father eke the child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And master on his men bestows the like with favour milde,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And good beginning of the year they wish and wish again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">According to the ancient guise of heathen people vaine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These eight days no man doth require his debtes of any man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their tables do they furnish forth with all the meat they can.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There were skating and sliding upon the ice in
Moorfields, where the shallow ponds froze easily; or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
they played at quarter-staff, at hocking, at single-stick,
at foot-ball, and at bucklers. In the evening they
played at cards and "tables" and dice.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now men and maids do merry make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At stool-ball and at barley-break<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On Shrove Tuesday they had cock-fighting, a sport
continued with unabated popularity until within the
memory of man&mdash;nay, it is rumored that he who
knows where to look for it may still enjoy that humanizing
spectacle. Every Friday in Lent the young
men went forth to Smithfield and held mock fights,
but the custom was in time discontinued; at Easter
they had boat tournaments. At this holy season also
they had boar fights, and the baiting of bulls and
bears. They had stage plays&mdash;the parish clerk in
Chaucer "played Herod on a scaffold high." In the
year 1391 the parish clerks had a play at Skinners
Well, Smithfield, which lasted for three days. In
1409 they represented the creation of the world, and
it lasted eight days.</p>

<p>Then there were the pageants, shows, and ridings
in the city. Here are two, out of several described
by Stow.</p>

<blockquote><p>Of triumphant shows made by the citizens of London, ye
may read, in the year 1236, the 20th of Henry III., Andrew
Bockwell then being mayor, how Eleanor, daughter to Reymond,
Earl of Provence, riding through the city towards Westminster,
there to be crowned Queen of England, the city was
adorned with silks, and in the night with lamps, cressets, and
other lights without number, besides many pageants and
strange devices there presented; the citizens also rode to meet
the king and queen, clothed in long garments embroidered
about with gold, and silks of divers colours, their horses gallantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
trapped to the number of three hundred and sixty, every
man bearing a cup of gold or silver in his hand, and the king's
trumpeters sounding before them. These citizens did minister
wine as bottlers, which is their service, at their coronation.
More, in the year 1293, for victory obtained by Edward I.
against the Scots, every citizen, according to their several
trade, made their several show, but especially the fish-mongers,
which in a solemn procession passed through the city, having,
amongst other pageants and shows, four sturgeons gilt, carried
on four horses; then four salmons of silver on four horses;
and after them six-and-forty armed knights riding on horses,
made like luces of the sea; and then one representing St. Magnus,
because it was upon St. Magnus' day, with a thousand
horsemen, &amp;c.</p>

<p>One other show, in the year 1377, was made by the citizens
for disport of the young prince, Richard, son to the Black
Prince, in the feast of Christmas, in this manner: On the Sunday
before Candlemas, in the night, one hundred and thirty
citizens, disguised, and well horsed, in a mummery, with sound
of trumpets, sackbuts, cornets, shalmes, and other minstrels,
and innumerable torch-lights of wax, rode from Newgate,
through Cheap, over the bridge, through Southwark, and so to
Kennington beside Lambhith, where the young prince remained
with his mother and the Duke of Lancaster his uncle,
the earls of Cambridge, Hertford, Warwick, and Suffolk, with
divers other lords. In the first rank did ride forty-eight in the
likeness and habit of esquires, two and two together, clothed
in red coats and gowns of say or sandal, with comely visors on
their faces; after them came riding forty-eight knights in the
same livery of colour and stuff; then followed one richly arrayed
like an emperor; and after him some distance, one
stately attired like a pope, whom followed twenty-four cardinals,
and after them eight or ten with black visors, not amiable,
as if they had been legates from some foreign princes. These
maskers, after they had entered Kennington, alighted from
their horses, and entered the hall on foot; which done, the
prince, his mother, and the lords, came out of the chamber
into the hall, whom the said mummers did salute, showing by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
a pair of dice upon the table their desire to play with the
prince, which they so handled that the prince did always win
when he cast them. Then the mummers set to the prince
three jewels, one after another, which were a bowl of gold, a
cup of gold, and a ring of gold, which the prince won at three
casts. Then they set to the prince's mother, the duke, the
earls, and other lords, to every one a ring of gold, which they
did also win. After which they were feasted, and the music
sounded, the prince and the lords danced on the one part with
the mummers, which did also dance; which jollity being
ended, they were again made to drink, and then departed in
order as they came.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whenever an excuse could be found, the Mayor,
Sheriffs, and Aldermen held a solemn riding in all
their bravery. Not even in Ghent or Antwerp were
there such splendid ridings and so many of them.
"Search all chronicles," says an old writer, "all histories
and records, in what language or letter soever, let
the inquisitive man waste the deere treasures of his
time and eyesight, he shall conclude his life only in
the certainty that there is no subject received into the
place of his government with the like style and magnificence
as is the Lord Mayor of the city of London."
We shall see later on what kind of show would be
held in the time of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>As for pageants, they were so splendid that he was
unhappy, indeed, who could not remember one. But
there were few so unfortunate. Whenever the King
paid a visit to the City, on his accession, on his marriage,
on the birth of a prince, the City held a pageant.
When you read the account of the pageant when
Henry V. and the City returned thanks for the victory
of Agincourt, remember to cover in imagination the
houses with scarlet cloth, to dress the people with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>
such bravery of attire and such colors as you can imagine,
to let music play at every corner, to let the
horses be apparelled as bravely as their riders, to let
the bells be pealing and clashing, to fill up the narrative
with the things which the historian neglects, and
then own that in the matter of pageants we are poor
indeed compared with our forefathers five hundred
years ago.</p>

<blockquote><p>On the king's return after the glorious field of Agincourt,
the Mayor of London and the Aldermen, apparelled in orient
grained scarlet, and four hundred commoners clad in beautiful
murrey, well mounted and trimly horsed, with rich collars and
great chains, met the King at Blackheath; and the clergy of
London in solemn procession with rich crosses, sumptuous
copes, and massy censers, received him at St. Thomas of Waterings.
The King, like a grave and sober personage, and as
one who remembered from Whom all victories are sent, seemed
little to regard the vain pomp and shows, insomuch that he
would not suffer his helmet to be carried with him, whereby
the blows and dints upon it might have been seen by the people,
nor would he suffer any ditties to be made and sung by
minstrels of his glorious victory, because he would the praise
and thanks should be altogether given to God.</p>

<p>At the entrance of London Bridge, on the top of the tower,
stood a gigantic figure, bearing in his right hand an axe, and
in his left the keys of the city hanging to a staff, as if he had
been the porter. By his side stood a female of scarcely less
stature, intended for his wife. Around them were a band of
trumpets and other wind instruments. The towers were
adorned with banners of the royal arms, and in the front of
them was inscribed <span class="smcap lowercase">CIVITAS REGIS JUSTICIE</span> (the City of the
King of Righteousness).</p>

<p>At the drawbridge on each side was erected a lofty column,
like a little tower, built of wood, and covered with linen; one
painted like white marble, and the other like green jasper.
They were surmounted by figures of the King's beasts,&mdash;an antelope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
having a shield of the royal arms suspended from his
neck, and a sceptre in his right foot; and a lion, bearing in his
right claw the royal standard unfurled.</p>

<p>At the foot of the bridge next the city was raised a tower,
formed and painted like the columns before mentioned; and,
in the middle of which, under a splendid pavilion, stood a most
beautiful image of St. George, armed, excepting his head, which
was adorned with a laurel crown, studded with jems and precious
stones. Behind him was a crimson tapestry, with his
arms (a red cross) glittering on a multitude of shields. On his
right hung his triumphal helmet, and on his left a shield of his
arms of suitable size. In his right hand he held the hilt of the
sword with which he was girt, and in his left a scroll, which,
extending along the turrets, contained these words, <span class="smcap lowercase">SOLI DEO
HONOR ET GLORIA</span>. In a contiguous house were innumerable
boys representing the angelic host, arrayed in white, with glittering
wings, and their hair set with sprigs of laurel; who, on
the King's approach, sang, accompanied by organs, an anthem,
supposed to be that beginning "Our King went forth to Normandy;"
and whose burthen is, "Deo gratias, Anglia, redde
pro victoria,"&mdash;printed in Percy's Reliques.</p>

<p>The tower of the Conduit on Cornhill was decked with a
tent of crimson cloth, and ornamented with the King's arms,
and those of Saints George, Edward, and Edmund. Under the
pavilion was a company of hoary prophets, in golden coats and
mantles, and their heads covered with gold and crimson; who,
when the King passed, sent forth a great quantity of sparrows
and other small birds, as a sacrifice agreeable to God, some of
which alighted on the King's breast, some rested on his shoulders,
and some fluttered round about him. And the prophets
then sang the psalm, Cantate Domino canticum novum, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The tower of the Conduit at the entrance of Cheap was hung
with green, and ornamented with scutcheons. Here sat twelve
venerable old men, having the names of the twelve Apostles
written on their foreheads, together with the twelve Kings,
Martyrs, and Confessors, of the succession of England, who
also gave their chaunt at the King's approach, and sent forth
upon him round leaves of silver mixed with wafers, and wine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
out of the pipes of the conduit, imitating Melchisedeck's reception
of Abraham, when he returned from his victory over the
Four Kings.</p>

<p>The Cross of Cheap was not visible, being concealed by a
beautiful castle, constructed of timber, and covered with linen
painted to resemble squared blocks of white marble and green
and crimson jasper. The arms of St. George adorned the summit,
those of the King and the Emperor were raised on halberds,
and the lower turrets had the arms of the royal family and the
great peers of the realm. On a stage in front came forth a
chorus of virgins with timbrel and dance, as to another David
coming from the slaughter of Goliath; their song of congratulation
was, "Welcome, Henry the Fifte, King of Englond and
of Fraunce." Throughout the building there was also a multitude
of boys, representing the heavenly host, who showered
down on the King's head small coins resembling gold, and
boughs of laurel, and sang, accompanied by organs, the Te
Deum laudamus.</p>

<p>The tower of the Conduit at the west end of Cheap was surrounded
with pavilions, in each of which was a virgin, who from
cups in their hands blew forth golden leaves on the King. The
tower was covered with a canopy made to resemble the sky
and clouds, the four posts of which were supported by angels,
and the summit crowned with an archangel of brilliant gold.
Beneath the canopy, on a throne, was a majestic image representing
the sun, which glittered above all things, and round it
were angels singing and playing all kinds of musical instruments.</p>

<p>This was the last of the pageantry, and, after the King had
paid his devotions at St. Paul's, he departed to his palace at
Westminster.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of ecclesiastical functions and processions I say
little. The people belonging to the Church, as well
as the churches themselves, were in every street and
in every function. At funerals there followed the
Brotherhood of Sixty, the singing clerks, and the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
priests of the Papey chanting the psalms for the dead.
And see, here is a company of a hundred and twenty.
They are not Londoners, they are Dutchmen; and
they have come across the sea&mdash;such are the amenities
of mediæval piety&mdash;to flagellate themselves for
the sins of this city. Will the English follow their
example and go to flog themselves at Amsterdam?
For there are sins to be expiated even in Holland.
They are stripped to the waist; every man is armed
with a whip, and is belaboring the man in front. It
is a moving spectacle. London cannot choose but
repent. The tears should be running down the cheeks
of toper, tosspot, and "rorere." Alas! we hear of no
tears. The Dutchmen have to go home again, and
may, if they please, flagellate themselves for their own
good, for London is impenitent.</p>

<p>Then there is the great day of the company&mdash;its
saint's day&mdash;the day of visible greatness for the trade.
On this day is the whole livery assembled; there must
be none absent, great or small: all are met in the hall,
every man in a new gown of the trade color. First
to church; the boys and singing clerks lead the way,
chanting as they go. Then march the Lord Mayor's
sergeants, the servants of the company, and the company
itself, with its wardens and the officers. Mass
despatched, they return home in the same order to
the hall, where they find a banquet spread for them,
such a banquet as illustrates the wealth and dignity
of the trade; the music is in the gallery, the floor is
spread with rushes newly laid, clean, and warm; the
air is fragrant with the burning of that scented Indian
wood called sanders; at the high table sit the master
or warden, the guests&mdash;even the King will sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
dine with a city company&mdash;and the court. Below, at
the tables, arranged in long lines, are the freemen of
the company, and not the men alone, but with every
man sits his wife, or, if he be a bachelor, he is permitted
to bring a maiden with him if he chooses. Think not
that a city company of the olden time would call together
the men to feast alone while the women stayed
at home. Not at all. The wardens knew very well
that there is no such certain guard, and preservative
of honesty and order, which are the first requisites for
the prosperity of trade, as the worship of man for
maiden and of maid for man.</p>

<p>When dinner is over, they will elect the officers for
the year, and doubtless hear a word of admonition on
the excellence of the work and the jealousy with
which the standard of good work should be guarded.
Then the loving-cup goes round, and the mummers
come in to perform plays and interludes, dressed up
in such fantastic guise as makes the women scream
and the men laugh and applaud.</p>

<p>On the day before Ascension Day there was beating
of the bounds, a custom still observed, but with
grievous shrinkage of the ceremonies.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest festival of the year was May
Day, which fell in the middle of our month of May.
It must be a hard year indeed when the east winds
are not over and done with by the middle of May.
Spring was upon them. Only think what was meant
by spring to a people whose winters were spent, as
must have been the case with most of them, in small
houses, dark and cold, huddled round the fire without
candles, going to bed early, rising before daylight,
eating no fresh meat, fruit, or vegetables, waiting impatiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
for the time to return when they would live
again in the open, shutters down and doors thrown
wide.</p>

<p>All the young people on the eve of May Day went
out into the fields to gather boughs and white-thorn
flowers. In Chaucer's "Court of Love," "Forth goeth
all the court, both most and least, to fetch the flowers
fresh." Later on, Herrick writes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come, my Corinna, come, and coming, mark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How each field turns a street, each street a park<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made green and trimmed with trees; see how<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devotion gives each house a bough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or branch; each porch, each door, on this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ark, a tabernacle is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made up of white thorn neatly interwoven.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was the prettiest festival in the world. In every
parish they raised a May-pole hung with garlands and
ribbons; they elected a Queen of the May, and they
danced and sang about their pole. The London parishes
vied with each other in the height and splendor
of the pole. One was kept in Gerrard's Hall, Basing
Lane (now swept away by the new streets). This
was forty feet high. A much later one, erected in
the Strand, 1661, in defiance to the Puritans, was 130
feet high. And there was the famous May-pole of
St. Andrews Under-shaft, destroyed by the Puritans
as an emblem of idolatry and profligacy. The girls
came back from their quest of flowers singing, but not
quite in these words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We have been rambling all the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And almost all the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now returning back again<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We have brought you a branch of May.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A branch of May we have brought you,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And at your door it stands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is but a sprout, but it's well budded out,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By the work of our Lord's hands.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And there was morris-dancing, with Robin Hood,
Friar Tuck, Little John, Tom the Piper, and Tom the
Fool, with hobby-horses, pipe and tabor, mummers
and devils, and I know not what; and Chepe and
Cornhill and Gracechurch Street were transformed
into leafy lanes and woodland ways and alleys cut
through hawthorn and wild rose. You may see to-day
the hawthorn and the wild rose growing in Epping
Forest, just as they grew four hundred years ago.
But the forest has been miserably curtailed of its proportions.
A great slice, wedge-shaped, has been cut
out bodily, and is now built upon. Hainault Forest
has perished these forty years, and is converted into
farms, save for a fragment, and of Middlesex Forest
nothing remains except the little piece enclosed in
Lord Mansfield's park. But in those days the forest
came down to the hamlet of Iseldun, afterwards Merry
Islington.</p>

<p>And in the month of June there were the burning
of bonfires to clear and cleanse the air, and the marching
of the watch on the vigils of St. John Baptist and
St. Peter.</p>

<p>Hear the testimony of Stow:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the months of June and July, on the vigils of festival days
and on the same festival days in the evenings after the sun setting,
there were usually made bonfires in the streets, every
man bestowing wood or labour towards them; the wealthier
sort also, before their doors near to the said bonfires, would
set out tables on the vigils, furnished with sweet bread and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
good drink, and on the festival days with meats and drinks
plentifully, whereunto they would invite their neighbours and
passengers also to sit and be merry with them in great familiarity,
praising God for His benefits bestowed on them. These
were called bonfires as well of good amity amongst neighbours,
that being before at controversy, were there, by the labour
of others, reconciled, and made of bitter enemies loving friends;
and also for the virtue that a great fire hath to purge the infection
of the air. On the vigil of St. John the Baptist, and
on St. Peter and Paul the Apostles, every man's door being
shadowed with green birch, long fennel, St. John's wort, orpin,
white lillies, and such like, garnished upon with garlands of
beautiful flowers, had also lamps of glass, with oil burning in
them all the night; some hung out branches of iron curiously
wrought, containing hundreds of lamps alight at once, which
made a goodly show, namely, in New Fish Street, Thames
Street, &amp;c. Then had ye besides the standing watches all in
bright harness, in every ward and street of this city and suburbs,
a marching watch, that passed through the principal
streets thereof, to wit, from the little conduit by Paul's Gate
to West Cheap, by the stocks through Cornhill, by Leadenhall
to Aldgate, then back down Fenchurch Street, by Grass
Church, about Grass Church conduit, and up Grass Church
Street into Cornhill, and through it into West Cheap again.
The whole way for this marching watch extendeth to three
thousand two hundred tailor's yards of assize; for the furniture
whereof with lights, there were appointed seven hundred cressets,
five hundred of them being found by the companies, the
other two hundred by the Chamber of London. Besides the
which lights every constable in London, in number more than
two hundred and forty, had his cresset: the charge of every
cresset was in light two shillings and fourpence, and every
cresset had two men, one to bear or hold it, another to bear a
bag with light, and to serve it, so that the poor men pertaining
to the cressets, taking wages, besides that every one had a
straw hat, with a badge painted, and his breakfast in the morning,
amounted in number to almost two thousand. The
marching watch contained in number about two thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
men, part of them being old soldiers of skill, to be captains,
lieutenants, sergeants, corporals, &amp;c., whifflers, drummers, and
fifes, standard and ensign-bearers, sword-players, trumpeters
on horseback, demilances on great horses, gunners with hand
guns, or half hakes, archers in coats of white fustian, signed
on the breast and back with the arms of the city, their bows
bent in their hands, with sheaves of arrows by their sides, pikemen
in bright corslets, burganets, &amp;c., halberds, the like billmen
in almaine rivets, and aprons of mail in great number;
there were also divers pageants, morris dancers, constables, the
one-half, which was one hundred and twenty, on St. John's
Eve, the other half on St. Peter's Eve, in bright harness, some
overgilt, and every one a jornet of scarlet thereupon, and a chain
of gold, his henchman following him, his minstrels before him,
and his cresset light passing by him, the waits of the city, the
mayor's officers for his guard before him, all in a livery of
worsted or say jackets party-coloured, the mayor himself well-mounted
on horseback, the sword-bearer before him in fair
armour well mounted also, the mayor's footmen, and the like
torch-bearers about him, henchmen twain upon great stirring
horses, following him. The sheriff's watches came one after
the other in like order, but not so large in number as the
mayor's; for where the mayor had besides his giant three
pageants, each of the sheriffs had besides their giants but two
pageants, each their morris dance, and one henchman, their officers
in jackets of worstead or say party-coloured, differing from
the mayor's, and each from other, but having harnessed men a
great many, &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the Feast of St. Bartholomew there were wrestlings,
foot-races, and shooting with the bow for prizes.
On Holyrood Day (September 14th) the young men
and the maidens went nutting in the woods. At Martinmas
(November 1st) there was feasting to welcome
the beginning of winter. Lastly, the old year ended
and the new year began with the mixture and succession
of religious services, pageants, shows, feasting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">{236}</a></span>
drinking, and dancing, which the London citizen of
every degree loved so much.</p>

<p>Then there were the City holidays. St. Lubbock
had predecessors. There were Christmas Day, Twelfth
Day, Easter, the day of St. John the Baptist, on June
24th, and of St. Peter and St. Paul, on June 29th.
On the last two days, to discourage the people from
keeping it up all night, the vintners had to close their
doors at ten.</p>

<p>The City of London has always been famous for the
great plenty and variety of its food. Beef, mutton,
and pork formed then, as now, the staple of the diet;
small beer was the drink of all, men, women, and children.
When, for instance, the Franciscans first set
up their humble cells, the small beer being short in
quantity, they did not drink water, but mixed water
with the beer, in order to make it go round. There
were so many fast-days in the year that fish was as
important a form of food as mutton or beef. They
ate lampreys, porpoise, and sturgeon, among other
fish. Ling, cod, and herring furnished them with salted
fish. Peacocks and swans adorned their tables at
great banquets. Their dishes were sweetened with
honey, for sugar was scarce, but spices were abundant.
By the thirteenth century they had begun to make
plentiful use of vegetables. They were fond of pounding
meats of different kinds, such as pork and poultry,
and mixing them in a kind of <i>rissole</i>. At a certain
great banquet, the menu of which has survived, there
appears neither beef nor mutton, probably because
those meats belonged to the daily life, but there are
great birds and little birds, brawn, rabbits, swans, and
venison for meats, soup of cabbage, then the <i>rissoles</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span>
just mentioned, and various sweetmeats. Their drink
was strong ale for banquets, hot spiced ale with a
toast, the loving-cup of hypocras, and for wines, Rhenish,
sack, Lisbon, and wine of Bordeaux.</p>

<p>Since every man in the City who practised a trade
must be a freeman and a member of a company or
trade guild, and since every company looked after its
livery, there should have been no poor in the City at
all. But performance falls short of promise; laws
cannot always be enforced; there was, it is quite certain,
a mass of poverty and worthlessness in the City
even in those days. Perhaps the City proper, with its
wards, was tolerably free from rogues and vagabonds,
but there were the suburb of Southwark, that of the
Strand, that already springing up outside Cripplegate,
and the city of Westminster. Plenty of room here
for rogues to find shelter. There were also the trades
of which the City took no heed, of minstrels, jugglers,
and actors, and all those who lived by amusing others;
also the calling of servant in every kind, as drover,
carter, wagoner, carrier, porter (not yet associated),
and so forth. And there were the men who would
never do any work at all, yet wanted as much drink
and food as the honest men who did their share. For
all these people, when they were hungry, there were
the charities of the great men, the bishops, and the
monasteries. For instance, the Earl of Warwick allowed
any man to take as much meat as he could
carry away on a dagger; the Bishop of Ely (but this
was later, in the sixteenth century) gave every day
bread, drink, and meat to two hundred poor people;
the Earl of Derby fed every day, twice, sixty old people;
thrice a week all comers; and on Good Friday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
2700 men and women. In the year 1293, being a
time of dearth, the Archbishop of Canterbury fed
daily four or five thousand. In 1171, Henry II., as
part of his penance for the murder of à Becket, fed
10,000 people from April till harvest. In the reign of
Edward III. the Bishop of Durham bestowed on the
poor every week eight quarters of wheat, besides the
broken victuals of his house.</p>

<p>The almshouses, of which there are so many still
existing, belong for the most part to a later time.
The citizens founded hospitals for the necessitous
as well as for the sick; they rebuilt and beautified
churches; they endowed charities, and gave relief to
poor prisoners. The first almshouses recorded were
founded in the fourteenth century by William Elsing,
mercer, who, in 1332, endowed a house for the support
of a hundred blind men, and by John Stodie, citizen
and vintner, Mayor in 1358, who built and endowed
thirteen almshouses for as many poor citizens. In
1415 William Sevenoke, citizen and grocer, founded a
school and almshouses in his native place, and two
years later Whittington founded by will his college
and almshouses. The college has been swallowed up,
but the almshouses remain, though transferred to
Highgate. After this the rich citizens began to remember
the poor in their wills, choosing rather, like
Philip Malpas, Sheriff in 1440, to give clothing to poor
men and women, marriage dowries to poor maidens,
and money for the highways than to bequeath the
money for the singing of masses or the endowment of
charities.</p>

<p>One more amusement must be mentioned, because
it is the only one of which the honest Londoners have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
never wearied. It is mentioned by the worthy Fitz
Stephen. It still continues to afford joy to millions.
The craftsman of the fourteenth century found it at
the Mermaid in Cornhill, or the Three Tuns of Newgate,
or the Swan of Dowgate, or the Salutation of
Billingsgate, or the Boar's Head of London Stone.
He found it in company with his fellows, and whether
he took it out of a glass or a silver mazer or a black
jack, he took it joyfully, and he took it abundantly.
Tosspots and swinkers were they then; tosspots and
swinkers are they still.</p>

<p>To set against this eagerness for pleasure, this avidity
after sports of every kind, we must remember the
continual recurrence of plague and pestilence, especially
in the fourteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> when the love of
shows and feasting was at its highest, and when the
Black Death carried off half the citizens. Is it not a
natural result? When life is so uncertain that men
know not to-day how many will be alive to-morrow,
they snatch impatiently at the present joy; it is too
precious to be lost; another moment, and the chance
will be gone&mdash;perhaps forever. As is the merriment
of the camp when the battle is imminent, so is the joy
of the people between the comings of the plague.
Life never seems so full of rich and precious gifts as
at such a time. As for the lessons in sanitation that
the plague should teach, the people had not as yet
begun to learn them. The lay stalls and the river-bank,
despite laws and proclamations, continued to be
heaped with filth, and the narrow street received the
refuse from every house. And, in addition to the occasional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
plague, there was ever present typhoidal fever
striking down old and young.</p>

<p>Perhaps the joy of the present was also intensified
by the possibility of famine. At the end of the twelfth
century there was a terrible famine. There was one
in 1251; there was one in 1314, when "no flesh was
to be had ... a quarter of wheat, beans, and peas was
sold for twenty shillings." This is something like
twenty pounds at present prices. This famine continued
throughout the next year, when Stow says "horse-flesh
was counted great delicates, the poore stole fatte
dogges to eate; some (as it was said), compelled
through famine, in hidden places, did eate the fleshe
of their owne children, and some stole others, which
they devoured. Thieves that were in prison did
plucke in pieces those that were newlie brought
among them, and greedily devoured them half alive."
The uncertainty whether next year would produce
any bread at all sweetened the loaf of to-day. In the
year 1335 long-continued rains caused a famine. In
1353 there was another; in 1438 the scarcity was so
great that bread was made from fern-roots, and so on.</p>

<p>The earliest schools of the City were those of St.
Paul's, Westminster, and the Abbey of Bermondsey.
Each of the religious houses in turn, as it was erected,
opened another school. When, however, Henry V.
had suppressed the alien priories, of which four certainly,
and perhaps more, belonged to London, their
schools were also suppressed. So much was the loss
felt that Henry VI., the greatest founder of schools of
all the kings, erected four new grammar-schools, namely:
at St. Martin's le Grand, St. Dunstan in the West,
St. Mary le Bow, and St. Anthony's; and in the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span>
year he made four more, namely: in the parishes
of St. Andrew's, Holborn; All Hallows the
Great, Thames Street; St. Peter's, Cornhill; and St.
Thomas of Acon.</p>

</div>

<p>But to what extent education prevailed, whether
the sons of craftsmen were taught to read and write
before they were apprenticed, I know not. For them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
the <i>trivium</i> and the <i>quadrivium</i> of the mediæval
school, the grammar, rhetoric, dialectic, music, arithmetic,
geometry, and astronomy could not possibly
be of use. On the other hand, one cannot understand
that the child of a respectable London craftsman
should be allowed to grow up to the age of fourteen
with no education at all. As for the children of gentle
birth, we know very well how they were taught.
Their education was planned so as to include very
carefully the mastery of those accomplishments which
we call good manners. It also included Latin, French,
reading, writing, poetry, and music. In the towns the
merchants and the better class understood very well
the necessity of education for their own needs. The
poor scholar, however&mdash;the lad who was born of humble
parents and received his education for nothing&mdash;was
a young man well known and recognized as a
common type. But he never intended his learning to
adorn a trade; rather should it lead him to the university,
to the Church, even to a bishopric. It is significant
that throughout Riley's <i>Memorials</i> there is no
mention of school or of education; there is no hint
anywhere how the children of the working-classes were
taught. One thing is certain, the desire for learning
was gradually growing and deepening in those years;
and when the Reformation set the Bible free, there
were plenty&mdash;thanks perhaps to King Henry's grammar-schools&mdash;in
the class of craftsmen who could read
it. But as yet we are two hundred years from the
freeing of the Book.</p>

<p>It is always found that the laws are strict in an inverse
proportion to the strength of the executive.
Thus, had the laws been properly carried out, London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
would have been the cleanest and the most orderly
town of the present, past, and future. Every man
was enjoined to keep the front of his house clean; no
refuse was to be thrown into the gutter; no one was
to walk the streets at night. When the curfew-bell
rang, first from St. Martin's, and afterwards from all
the churches together, the gates of the City were
closed; the taverns were shut; no one was allowed
to walk about the streets; no boats were to cross the
river; the sergeants of Billingsgate and Queenhithe
had each his boat, with its crew of four men, to guard
the river and the quays; guards were posted at the
closed gates; a watch of six men was set in every
ward, all the men of the ward being liable to serve
upon it. These were excellent rules. Yet we find
men haled before the Mayor charged with being common
<i>roreres</i> (roarers), with beating people in the streets,
enticing them into taverns, where they were made to
drink and to gamble. Among the common <i>roreres</i>
was once found, alas! a priest. What, however, were
the other people doing in the street after curfew?
And why were not the taverns shut? As is the
strength of the ruling arm, so should be the law. We
are not ourselves free from the reproach of passing
laws which cannot be enforced because they are
against the will of the people, and the executive is
too weak to carry them out against that will. People,
you see, cannot be civilized by statute.</p>

<p>The wages and hours of work of the craftsman
have not been satisfactorily ascertained. The day's
work probably meant the whole day. Like the rustic,
he would begin in the summer at five and leave off at
7.30, with certain breaks. In winter he would work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
through the daylight. His wages, which were ordered
for the craft by the company, seem to have been ample
so long as employment was continuous. But the
crafts were always complaining of foreign competition.
Edward IV., in 1463, states that owing to the import
of wares fully wrought and ready made for sale, "artificers
cannot live by their mysteries and occupations
as they have done
in times past, but
divers of them, as
well householders
as hirelings, and
under-servants
and apprentices in
great numbers, be
this day unoccupied,
and do hardly
live in great
misery, poverty,
and need." Therefore the statute enumerates a long
list of things that are not to be exported. Among
these we observe knives, razors, scissors&mdash;showing that
the cutlery trade was already flourishing then&mdash;but
not swords, spear-heads, or armor of any kind. Actual
artificers were not to be employers but only servants;
those already established could sell in gross but not
in retail, and they were not to have alien servants.
That there was discontent among the working-men
is clear from these statutes and from the constant
attempts of the craftsmen to form journeyman, or
yeoman guilds, whose real objects, though they might
mask them under the name of religion, were to increase
wages and keep out new-comers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span></p>

<p>Apart from the question of wages, what the craftsmen
wanted was what the masters, too, demanded&mdash;"encouragement
of natives, discouragement of foreigners,
the development of shipping, and the amassing
of treasure."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Such were the people of London in the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries. Such was Plantagenet London,
the land of Cocaigne&mdash;Cockney Land&mdash;whither
the penniless young gentleman, the son of the country
squire, made his way in search of the fortune
which others had picked up on its golden pavement.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Strewed with gold and silver sheen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Cockneys' streets no molde is seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pancakes be the shingles alle<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Running rivers, grete and fine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hypocras and ale and wine.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, indeed, a pavement of flints and stones the
City offered to any who tried to win her fortunes save
by the way prescribed. Of course there were&mdash;there
always are&mdash;many who cannot enter by the appointed
gate, nor keep to the ordered way. As it is now, so
it was then. There were rogues and cheats; there
were men who preferred any way of life to the honest
way. How the City in its wisdom dealt with those
we shall now see.</p>

<p>At first sight one may be struck with the leniency
of justice. In cases which in later years were punished
by flogging at the cart-tail, by hanging, by long
imprisonment, the criminal of the fourteenth century
stood in pillory, or was made to ride through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
streets, the nature of his crime symbolized by something
hung from his neck. There were as yet no
burnings, no slicing off of ears; there was no rack, no
torture by rope, boot, or water. It is true that those
who ventured upon violence to the sacred person of
an Alderman were liable to have the right hand struck
off; but at the last moment
that officer always
begged and obtained a
commutation, while the
criminal made humble
submission. Those who
have entered upon an inheritance
of law-abiding
and of order have forgotten
by what severities
men were forced into external
forms of respect
for the officers of justice.
Then, again, the Alderman
knew every man in
his ward; he was no
stranger among his people;
he knew the circumstances
and the condition
of every one; he
was punishing a brother
who had brought the
ward into disrepute by his unruly conduct; he was
therefore tender, saving the dignity of his office and
his duty to the city.</p>

<p>For instance, it was once discovered that wholesale
robberies were carried on by certain bakers who made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
holes in their moulding-boards, and so filched the
dough. These rogues in the last century would have
been flogged unmercifully. Robert de Bretaigne,
Mayor <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1387, was satisfied by putting them in pillory
till after vespers at St. Paul's, with dough hung
about their necks, so that all the world might know
why they were there. When certain "tapicers" were
charged with selling false blankets, that is, blankets
which had been "vamped" in foreign parts with the
hair of oxen and cows, the blankets were ordered to
be burned. On the other hand, highway robbery,
burglaries, and some cases of theft were punished by
hanging. The unhappy Desiderata de Torgnton, for
instance, in an evil moment stole from a servant of
the Lady Alice de Lisle thirty dishes and twenty-four
salt-cellars of silver. The servant was bound by sureties
that he would prosecute for felony, and did so,
with the result that Desiderata was hanged, and her
chattels confiscated; but of chattels had she none.</p>

<p>For selling putrid meat the offender was put in pillory,
and the bad meat&mdash;dreadful addition to the sentence&mdash;burned
beneath his nose. The sale of "false"
goods&mdash;that is, things not made as they should be
made, either of bad materials or of inferior materials&mdash;was
always punished by destruction of the things.</p>

<p>What should be done to a man who spoke disrespectfully
of the Mayor? One Roger Torold, citizen
and vintner, in the year of grace 1355, and in the
twenty-eighth year of our Sovereign Lord King Edward
III., said one day, in the presence of witnesses,
that he was ready to defy the Mayor; and that if he
should catch the Mayor outside the City, then the
Mayor should never come back to it alive. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>
things being reported, the Mayor caused him to be
brought before himself, the Aldermen, and Sheriffs at
the Guildhall. The prisoner confessed his crime, and
put himself upon the favor of the Court. He was
committed to prison while the Court considered what
should be done to him. Being brought to the bar, he
offered to pay a fine of one hundred tuns of wine for
restoration to the favor of the Mayor. This was accepted,
on the condition that he should also make a
recognizance of £40 sterling to be paid if ever again
he should abuse or insult the name or person of the
Mayor. For perjury, the offender was, for a first
crime, taken to the Guildhall, and there placed upon
a high stool, bareheaded, before the Mayor and Aldermen.
For the second offence he was placed in pillory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
For women, the thew was substituted for the
pillory. One Alice, wife of Robert de Causton, stood
in the thew for thickening the bottom of a quart-pot
with pitch, so as to give short measure. The said
quart-pot was divided into two parts, of which one
half was tied to the pillory in sight of the people, and
the other half was kept in the Guildhall.</p>

<p>Death by hanging or pillory. These were almost
the only punishments. The cases before the Mayor's
Court remind us of the remarkable resemblance we
bear to our ancestors. They are monotonous because
they read like the cases in a modern Police Court.
Giles Pykeman goes in terror of his life, because certain
persons threaten him, but they find surety for
good behavior. John Edmond Commonger, convicted
of passing off bad oats for good&mdash;pillory. John
William, for passing off rings of latten as rings of gold&mdash;pillory.
Nicolas Mollere, for spreading false news&mdash;pillory,
with a whetstone round his neck to mark
the offence. Heavens! if this offence were again
made penal. John Mayn, indicted for being a leper&mdash;banished
out of the city. Robert Brebason, stock
fish-monger, charged with assault in presence of the
Mayor. Not a case for pillory this: let him be imprisoned
for a year and a day in Newgate. Alice
Sheltoir, charged with being a common scold&mdash;to the
thew. John Rykorre, cordwainer, for forging a bond&mdash;pillory.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the times I give the story of
William Blakeney. He was a shuttle-maker by trade,
but a pilgrim by profession. He dressed for the part
with long hair, long gown, and bare feet. He loitered
about in places where men resorted&mdash;taverns and such&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
there entertained all comers with travellers'
tales. He had been everywhere, this pious and adventurous
pilgrim. He had seen Seville, city of sacred
relics; Rome, the abode of his Holiness the Pope; he
had even seen the Pope himself. He had been to the
Holy Land, and stood within the very sepulchre of
our Lord. And what with the strange creatures he
had met with in those far-off lands, and the men and
women among whom he had sojourned, and the things
he could tell you, and the things which he postponed
till the next time, the story would fill volumes. For
six years he lived in great comfort, eating and drinking
of the best, always at the expense of his hearers.
This man must have been an unequalled story-teller.
Six years of invention ever fresh and new! Then he
was found out&mdash;he had never been a pilgrimage in his
life. He had never been out of sight of the London
walls. So he stood in pillory&mdash;this poor novelist, who
would in these days have commanded so much respect
and such solid rewards&mdash;he stood in pillory, with a
whetstone round his neck, as if he had been a common
liar! And then he had to go back to the dull
monotony of shuttle-making, and that in silence, with
nobody to believe him any more. Well, he shortly
afterwards died, I am convinced, of suppressed fiction.
But perhaps his old friends rallied round him, and by
the light of the fire he still beguiled the long evenings
by telling for the hundredth time of the one-eyed
men, and the men with tails, and the men who have
but one leg, and use their one foot for an umbrella
against the scorching sun&mdash;all of whom he had seen
in the deserts on the way from Jerusalem to Damascus,
where St. Paul was converted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span></p>

<p>On a day in the beginning of October, 1382, there
was great excitement in the parish of St. Mildred,
Poultry. A certain mazer, or silver cup, the property
of Dame Matilda de Eye, had been stolen. Now,
whether Alan, the water-carrier, had his suspicions, or
whether he was himself suspected, or whether he
wished to fix the guilt on somebody else, I know not,
but he repaired to the house of Robert Berewold, of
great repute for art magic, and inquired of him as to
the real thief. Whereupon Robert took a loaf, and
in the top of it fixed a round peg of wood, and four
knives at the four sides, so as to present the figure
of a cross. He then did "soothsaying and art
magic" over the loaf. After which he declared that
Johanne Wolsy was the person who had stolen the
cup.</p>

<p>This thing being bruited abroad, and the voice of
the indignant Johanne ascending to the ears of the
Aldermen, the said Robert was attached to make answer
to the Mayor and commonalty as in a plea of
deceit and falsehood. Answer there was none. Whereupon
Robert stood in pillory for one hour, the loaf,
peg, and knives hung about his neck; and on the following
Sunday he went to the parish church&mdash;it is
now pulled down&mdash;and in the presence of the congregation
confessed that he had falsely defamed the
same Johanne. Meantime Alan, one may believe,
had consigned the mazer to a safe place, and joined
in the congratulations of Johanne's friends.</p>

<p>Would you know how a young married couple set
up house-keeping? Here is the inventory of the
household furniture of such a pair in the fourteenth
century. It is not the only document of the kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
which exists, but it is interesting because it forms
part of a story which remains unfinished.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 263px;"><a name="ANCIENT_PLATE" id="ANCIENT_PLATE"></a>
<img src="images/page_254.jpg" width="263" height="324" alt="ANCIENT PLATE" title="" />
<span class="caption">ANCIENT PLATE</span>
</div>

<p>The inventory belongs to the year 1337. The proprietor's
name was Hugh le Bevere; that of his wife
Alice. Hugh le Bevere was a craftsman of the better
sort, but not a master.
He was so well
off that the furniture
of his house, including
clothes, was valued
at £12 18<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>,
which, being interpreted
into modern
money, means about
£200. He had been
married but a short
time when the events
occurred which
caused this inventory
to be drawn up.
The newly-married
pair lived in a house
consisting of two
rooms, one above the other. The lower room, which
was kitchen and keeping-room in one, was divided from
the houses on either side by solid stone walls; it had
a chimney and a fireplace; the walls were hung round
with kitchen utensils, tools, and weapons; a window
opened to the street, the upper part of which was
glazed, while the lower part could be closed by a stout
shutter; the door opened into the street; there was
another door at the back, which opened upon a buttery,
where there stood ranged in a row six casks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
wine. One folding-table and two chairs served for
their wants, because they were not rich enough to entertain
their friends. A ladder led to the upper room,
which was an attic or garret, built of wood and
thatched with rush. Here was the bed with a mattress,
three feather beds, and two pillows. A great
wooden coffer held their household gear; here were
six blankets and one serge, a coverlet with shields of
sendall (a kind of thin silk), eight linen sheets, four
table-cloths. The clothes, which were laid in chests
or hung upon the wall, consisted of three surcoats of
worsted and ray; one coat with a hood of perset
(peach-colored cloth), and another of worsted; two
robes of perset; one of medley, furred; one of scarlet,
furred; a great hood of sendall with edging; one
camise (only one!) and half a dozen savenapes (aprons).
One perceives that the inventory omits many things.
Where, for instance, were the hosen and the shoon?
For kitchen utensils there were brass pots, a grate,
andirons, basins, washing vessels, a tripod, an iron
horse, an iron spit, a frying-pan, a funnel, and two
ankers&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> tubs. They had one candlestick "of lattone;"
two plates; an aumbrey (cabinet or small cupboard);
curtains to hang before the doors to keep out
the cold; cushions and a green carpet; and for the
husband a haketon, or suit of leather armor, and an
iron head-piece. Of knives, forks, wooden plates, cups,
glasses, or drinking measures there is nothing said at
all. But it is evident that the house was provided
with everything necessary for solid comfort; plenty
of kitchen vessels, for instance, and plenty of soft
feather-beds, blankets, pillows, curtains, and sheets.</p>

<p>Every morning at six o'clock, after a hunch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
bread, a substantial slice of cold meat, and a pull at
the black-jack of small ale, Hugh le Bevere walked off
to his day's work. Then Alice, left at home, washed
and scoured, made and mended, cooked the dinner,
talked to the neighbors, and, when all was done, sat in
the door-way enjoying the sunshine and spinning
busily.</p>

<p>They had been married but a short time. There
were no children. Then&mdash;one knows nothing; one
must not judge harshly; there may have been jealousy;
there may have been cause for jealousy; perhaps
the woman had a tongue unendurable (fourteenth-century
tongues were cruelly sharp); perhaps
the man had a temper uncontrolled (in that century
there were many such); but no one knows, and, again,
we must not judge&mdash;then, I say, the end came, suddenly
and without warning. When it was all over,
some of the neighbors thought they had heard high
words and a smothered shriek, but then we often
think we have heard what probably happened. In
the morning Hugh le Bevere went not forth to his
work as usual; Alice did not open the door; the
shutters remained closed. The neighbors knocked;
there was no answer. They sent for the Alderman,
who came with his sergeants, and broke open the
door. Alas! alas! They found the body of Alice
lying stark and dead upon the floor; beside her sat
her husband with white face and haggard eyes, and
the evidence of his crime, the knife itself, lying where
he had thrown it.</p>

<p>They haled him to the Lord Mayor's Court. They
questioned him. He made no reply at first, looking
as one distraught; when he spoke, he refused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
plead. For this, in later times, he would have been
pressed to death. What was done to him was almost
as bad; for they took him to Newgate, and shut him
up in a cell with penance&mdash;that is to say, on bread and
water&mdash;until he died.</p>

<p>This done, they buried the unfortunate Alice, and
made the inventory of all the chattels, which the City
confiscated, and sold for £12 18<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, out of which, no
doubt, they paid for the funeral
of the woman and the
penance of the man. The
rest, one hopes, was laid out
in masses, as far as it would go, for the souls of the
hapless pair. Death has long since released Hugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
le Bevere; he has entered his plea before another
Court; but the City has never learned why he killed
his wife, or if, indeed, he really did kill her.</p>

<p>Of Plantagenet London this is my picture. You
see a busy, boisterous, cheerful city; with the exception
of the cities of Ghent and Bruges and Antwerp,
the busiest and the most prosperous city of the western
world, with the greatest liberty of the people,
the greatest plenty of all good things, and the happiest
conditions of any town. You have seen that
though the sovereign was King within as well as without
the walls, there was no other Over-Lord; the
royal hand was sometimes heavy, but its weight was
better to bear than the internal dissensions that ravaged
the Italian cities; it was better that London
should suffer with the rest of the country than that
she should sit, like Venice, secure and selfish beside
her quays, though the people of the land behind were
torn with civil wars and destroyed by famine and
overrun by a foreign enemy.</p>

<p>When we think of this period let us never forget its
external splendor&mdash;the silken banners, the heralds in
their embroidered coats, the livery of the great lords,
the Mayor and Aldermen in their robes riding to hear
mass at St. Paul's, the cloth of gold, the vair and miniver,
the ermine and the sable, the robes of perset and
the hoods of sendall, the red velvet and the scarlet
silk, the great gold chains, the caps embroidered with
pearls, the horses with their trappings, the banners
and the shields, the friars jostling the parish priests,
the men-at-arms, the city ladies, as glorious with their
raiment as the ladies of the court, the knights, the
common folk, the merchant, and the prentice. Mostly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span>
I like to think of the prentice. One always envies
the young; theirs is the inheritance. The prentice
lived amid these glories, which seemed like pageants
invented entirely for his delight. It was time when
the fleeting shows and vanities of life were valued all
the more because they were so fleeting. He looked
around, and his heart swelled with the joy of thinking
that some day these things would fall to him if he
was lucky, diligent, and watchful. His was the threefold
vow of industry, obedience, and duty. By keeping
this vow he would attain to the place and station
of his master.</p>

<p>For the continued noise and uproar of the City, for
its crowds, for its smells, the people cared nothing.
They were part of the City. They loved everything
that belonged to it&mdash;their great cathedral; their hundred
churches; their monasteries; their palaces and
the men-at-arms; the nobles, priests, and monks; the
Mayor and Aldermen; the ships and the sailors; the
merchants and the craftsmen; the ridings and the
festivals and the holy days; the ringing, clinging,
clashing of the bells all day long; the drinking at the
taverns; the wrestling and the archery; the dancing;
the pipe and tabor; the pageants, and the mumming
and the love-making&mdash;all, all they loved. And they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>
thought in their pride that there was not anywhere in
the whole habitable world&mdash;witness the pilgrims and
the ship-captains, who had seen the whole habitable
world&mdash;any city that might compare with famous
London Town.</p>

<p class="p3">I. SPRING-TIME AMONG THE RUINS</p>


<p>If the London of the Third Edward was a city
of palaces, that of Queen Elizabeth was a city of
ruins.</p>

<p>Ruins everywhere! Ruins of cloisters, halls, dormitories,
courts, and chapels, and churches. Ruins
of carved altar-pieces, canopies, statues, painted windows,
and graven fonts. Ruins of old faiths and old
traditions. Ruins everywhere. Only consider what
became of the monastic buildings. King Edward's
Cistercian House, called the New Abbey, or Eastminster,
was pulled "clean down," and in its place storehouses
for victuals and ovens for making ships' biscuits
were set up. On the abbey grounds were erected
small tenements for poor working-people, the only
inhabitants of that neighborhood where is now the
Mint. Sir Arthur Darcie it was who did this. The
Convent of St. Clare, called the Minories, was similarly
treated, its site converted into storehouses. The old
buildings are always said to have been entirely pulled
down, but their destruction was never thorough. Walls
were everywhere left standing, because it was too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
much trouble to pull them down. For instance, the
north wall of the present mean little Church of the
Holy Trinity, Minories, ugliest and meanest of all
modern London churches, was formerly part of the
wall of the nuns' chapel.</p>

<span class="caption">BOAR IN EASTCHEAP</span>
</div>

<p>More fortunate than the other monastic churches,
that of the Austin Friars was allowed to remain standing.
The nave was walled off and assigned to the
Dutch residents, with
whom it has continued
to this day. You may
attend the service on
Sunday, and while the
preacher in the black
gown addresses his
scanty audience in the
language which, though
it sounds so much like
English, you cannot understand,
you may look about you, and think of the
Augustine Brothers who built this church. In their
time it was filled with monuments, of which not a single
one now remains. The nave was greatly damaged
by a fire in 1862, but the walls and columns of the ancient
church remain. The rest of the church, including
the finest and most beautiful spire in the whole city,
was all pulled down by the Marquis of Winchester,
who broke up and sold the whole of the monuments
for £100. In this church were buried, among other
illustrious dead, the great Hubert de Burgh; Edmund
Plantagenet, half brother to Richard II.; the barons
who fell at the battle of Barnet; Richard FitzAlan,
Earl of Arundel, beheaded 1397; the Earl of Oxford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
beheaded 1463; and Edward Strafford, Duke of Buckingham,
beheaded 1521. Winchester House, which
stood till fifty years ago, was built on part of the abbey
grounds; Cromwell House, on a site where now stands
the Drapers' Hall, on another part.</p>

<p>The Priory of the Holy Trinity, granted to Sir
Thomas Audley, fared worse still, for the whole church&mdash;choir,
transepts, nave, steeple, and all&mdash;was, with
great labor, pulled down, and the whole materials and
monuments sold for paving or building stones at sixpence
a cart-load. The ring of nine bells was divided
between Stepney Church and St. Katherine Cree,
where, I believe, they still hang and do their duty.
So much, and that is all, is left of this proud foundation.
Sir Thomas Audley, who obtained the precinct
by gift of the King, built a house upon it. His daughter
and heiress marrying the Duke of Norfolk, the
house and grounds were named after their new owner.
Duke's Place and Duke Street preserve the new name.
The former, now a mean square, crowded with Jews
engaged in the fruit trade, is certainly the site of one
of the courts of the old priory. It is at the back
of St. Katherine Cree Church in Leadenhall Street.
Strange, that of this most rich and splendid house not
a vestige should remain either of name, or building,
or tradition.</p>

<p>Crutched Friars' Church was made into a carpenter's
shop and a tennis court. Their refectory, a very
noble hall, became a glass-house, and was burned to
the ground in the year 1575.</p>

<p>St. Mary's Spital, outside Bishopsgate, which had
been a hospital with one hundred and eighty beds,
was entirely destroyed and built over. But Spital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
Square, which now remains, marks the site of the
church-yard, where stood (in the north-east corner)
the famous spital pulpit, from which, for three hundred
years, sermons were preached at Easter before
the Lord Mayor and Aldermen and the citizens. It
is an illustration of English conservatism that long
after the hospital was demolished, and when the pulpit
stood in an ordinary square of private residences,
the same custom was kept up, with the same official
attendance of the corporation.</p>

<p>The Nunnery of St. Helen's became the property
of the Leathersellers' Company. The nuns' chapel
still remains forming the north part of a church, which,
for its antiquity and its monuments, is one of the
most interesting in London. The nuns' refectory
formed the Company's Hall until the year 1790, when,
with its ancient crypt, it was pulled down to make
way for the present St. Helen's Place. Considerable
ruins of the nunnery remained until the same time.</p>

<p>The Church of the Knights Hospitallers was blown
up with gunpowder; its ruins and those of the priory
buildings remained for many years. The Charter
House was first given by Henry VIII. to Sir Thomas
Audley, passed from him to Lord North, to Dudley,
Duke of Northumberland, to Lord North again, to the
Duke of Norfolk, to the Crown, to the Earl of Suffolk,
and to Thomas Sutton. The last transfer was in 1611.
Sutton endowed it as a charity under the name of
the Hospital of King James. This noble foundation
has ever since existed as a hospital for decayed gentlemen
and a school for boys. Some of the old monastic
buildings yet survive in the Charter House. Its
name of the Hospital of King James has long been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
forgotten. The place has been celebrated by Thackeray,
and it is, at this day, the most beautiful and the
most venerable monument of old London.</p>

<p>The magnificent Church of the Dominicans, or
Black Friars, was destroyed. Either the hall of the
abbey or a portion of the church was used as a storehouse
for the "properties" of pageants&mdash;strange fate
for the house of the Dominicans, those austere upholders
of doctrine. A play-house was erected by
Shakespeare and his friends among the ruins, which
remained standing for a long time. Only a few years
ago the extension of the <i>Times</i> offices in Printing
House Square brought to light many substantial remains.
The Abbey of Bermondsey furnished materials
and a site for a great house for the Earl of Sussex.
A tavern was built on the site, of the Church of St.
Martin's le Grand. The Church of St. Bartholomew's
Priory was pulled down to the choir, which was converted
into a parish church. The bells were put up in
the tower of St. Sepulchre. The Church of the Grey
Friars was spared; but as for its monuments&mdash;consider!
There were buried here the queens of Edward
I. and Edward II., the queen of David Bruce,
an innumerable company of great lords, nobles, and
fighting men, with their dames and daughters. The
place was a Campo Santo of mediæval worthies. Their
monuments, Stow writes, "are wholly defaced. There
were nine tombs of alabaster and marble, environed
with 'strikes' of iron, in the choir, and one tomb in
the body of the church, also coped with iron, all pulled
down, besides sevenscore gravestones of marble."
The whole were sold for £50 or thereabouts by Sir
Martin Bowes, goldsmith and Alderman of London.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
Surely the carved marble and sculptured alabaster did
not teach the hated papistical superstitions; yet they
all went; and it was with bare walls, probably washed
white or yellow to hide the frescos, that the building
became the parish now called Christ Church. The
monastery buildings were converted into the Bluecoat
School.</p>

<p>Such was the fate of the greater houses. Add to
these the smaller foundations, all whelmed in the
common destruction; the colleges, such as that of St.
Spirit, founded by Whittington; that founded by
Walworth; that founded by Richard III., attached
to Allhallows Barking; St. John's, Holywell; St.
Thomas of Acon, a rich foundation with a lovely
church; the College of Jesus; the Hospital of St.
Anthony; Jesus Commons; Elsing Spital; and we
begin to realize that London was literally a city of
ruins.</p>

<p>It is at first hard to understand how there should
have been, even among the baser sort, so little reverence
for the past, so little regard for art; that these
treasure-houses of precious marbles and rare carvings
should have been rifled and destroyed without raising
so much as a murmur; nay, that the very buildings
themselves should have been pulled down without a
protest. Once only the citizens remonstrated. It
was in the hope of saving from destruction the lofty
and most beautiful spire of Austin Friars, but in vain.
It seems to us impossible that the tombs of so many
worthies should have been destroyed without the indignation
of all who knew the story of the past. Yet
in our own day we have seen&mdash;nay, we see daily&mdash;the
wanton and useless destruction of ancient buildings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
Winchester House, which ought to have been kept as
a national monument, was pulled down in 1839; Sir
Paul Pinder's house, another unique specimen, vanished
only yesterday; within the last few years a
dozen city churches have been destroyed, in total disregard
to their historical associations. At this very
moment the church where John Carpenter, Whittington's
executor and the founder of the City of London
school, the church whose site has been consecrated as
long as that of any church in the city, where King
Alfred may have worshipped, is standing roofless,
waiting to make way for offices not wanted. Nay,
the very city clergy themselves, the official guardians
of all that is venerable, have, in our own days&mdash;the
actual, living city clergy!&mdash;basely sold their most
beautiful old house, Sion College, and built a new
and garish place on the Thames Embankment, which
they call Sion College! It is unfortunately too true
that there is not, at any time or with any people, reverence
for things venerable, old, and historical, save
with a few. The greater part are careless of the past,
unable to see or feel anything but the present. The
city clergy of to-day are no better than Sir Thomas
Audrey, Sir Arthur Darcie, and the rest.</p>

<p>There were other ruins. Cromwell's men were not
the only zealots against popish monuments, signs, and
symbols. The parish churches were filled with ruins.
The carved fonts were defaced; the side chapels were
desolate and empty; the altars were stripped; the rood
screens were removed; the roods themselves were
taken down; the painted walls were whitewashed; the
simple service that was read in the vulgar tongue
seemed to the people at first a ruin of the old mass;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
the clergyman, called minister or priest, who preached
in the black gown, was a ruin of the priest in his
gorgeous robes; the very doctrines of the Protestant
faith seemed at first built out of the ruins of the old,
as the second Temple was built upon the ruins of the
first, and was but a poor thing in comparison. At
first only, because the work was thorough, and in a
single generation all the traditions of the ancient
faith were lost and forgotten.</p>

<p>If, indeed, the Reformation was to be carried at all,
it was necessary, for the prevention of civil war, that
it should be thorough. Therefore the young generation
must be made to believe that a return of the old
things was absolutely impossible; that the old religion
could never, under any circumstances, be revived.
When Queen Mary ascended the throne, the work
was only half done; the Protestant faith had not yet
taken root; yet when she died, five years later, no
lamentations were made over the second departure of
the priests. It is a commonplace that the flames of
Smithfield, more than the preaching of Latimer, reconciled
the people to the loss of the old religion. I
do not think that the commonplace is more than half
true, because the flames were again kindled, and more
than once, in the reign of Elizabeth without any murmur
from the people. Henceforth the old religion
was dead indeed, and impossible to be revived. When
Shakespeare came up to London, he found many who
could remember the monks&mdash;gray, white, and black;
the Franciscan&mdash;innocent of the old simplicity; the
rich and stately Benedictine; the austere Dominican;
the pardoner and the limitour; the mass, and the
holy days of the Church; but we find in Shakespeare's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
writings no trace of any regret for their disappearance,
or of any desire for their return. The
past was gone; even the poetic side of a highly poetic
time was not touched, or hardly touched, by the sadness
and pathos of this great fall; the dramatists and
poets have made nothing out of it.</p>

<p>The people lived among the ruins but regarded
them not, any more than the vigorous growth within
the court of a roofless Norman castle regards the donjon
and the walls. They did not inquire into the
history of the ruins; they did not want to preserve
them; they took away the stones and sold them for
new buildings.</p>

<p>It was very remarkable and very fitting that on the
site of the Grey Friars' House should be erected a great
school. The teaching of the new thought was established
in the place where those dwelt who had been
the most stalwart defenders of the old. It was also
very remarkable and very fitting that within the walls
of Black Friars' Abbey, the home of austerity and
authority, should rise a play-house for the dramas of
free thought and human passion. It was further remarkable
and very fitting that the house of the Carthusian
monks, those who had fled from the work, and
war, and temptations of the world, those who, while
yet living, were already dead, should be converted
into a home for those who were broken down and
spent with that very work and war, a place where
they could meditate in their old age over the storm
and struggle of the past.</p>

<p>Once arrived at the second half of the sixteenth
century we are in modern times. We have maps,
surveys, descriptions of the city; we have literature in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
plenty to illustrate the manners of the time. There
is no longer any doubt upon any point. The daily
life of London under Elizabeth and the first James
may be learned in all its details, by any one who will
take the trouble to read, as easily as the daily life in
our own time. Perhaps more easily, because things
which are so trivial and yet mean so much are passed
over or taken for granted in the literature of our day.
But let no one be content with reading the modern
books upon the Elizabethan period. They contain a
great deal, but the literature of the time itself is a
storehouse, into which every one who wishes, however
lightly, to study the time should look for himself.
And it is a storehouse so full that no man can hope
to exhaust though he could carry out of it load upon
load of treasure.</p>

<p>Before me hangs a fac-simile of the map made by
Ralph Agas. "Civitas Londinium." One remarks
first, that the part lying south of Chepe is still the
most crowded, yet not so crowded that there are no
open spaces. Between Size Lane, for instance, and
Walbrook is a great garden. Behind Whittington
College is a large open court, which was also certainly
a garden. There are gardens in Blackfriars of which
the only remains at the present day are the pretty
little square called Wardrobe Court and the tiny garden&mdash;I
believe there is still one other garden left&mdash;at
the back of the rectory of St. Andrew's. North of
Chepe the streets are wider, and the open spaces larger
and more frequent. At Grey Friars, already the Bluecoat
School, the courts of the monastery are yet standing
with the church, and the great garden still stretches
unto the city wall; in the corner of the wall, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">{277}</a></span>
is now Monkwell Street, with Barber Surgeon's Hall,
is a fine large garden. On either side of Coleman
Street there are very extensive gardens; those on the
west belonged to the Augustine Friars, the last remnant
of which, the Drapers' Garden, was built over a
few years ago to the enrichment of the Company and
the loss of the city. Some part of the gardens of the
Holy Trinity Priory remain. There are gardens and
trees and an open space within Aldgate; and an open
court, or series of courts, where had been the nunnery
of St. Helen's. Without the walls, on the east, East
Smithfield is a large field, with paths across. The
sites of New Abbey and the convent of the Clare Sisters
are marked by courts and gardens. Houses stand
north and south along the Whitechapel Road, but not
far; a single row of houses runs along Hound's ditch
from Aldgate to Bishopsgate. Without the latter
there is a line of houses as far as Shoreditch Church,
and here the open country begins. Finsbury and
Moorfields are to a great extent divided up into gardens,
each with its house, reminding one of Stubbes's
complaint against the citizens' wives and daughters,
that they use their husbands' gardens outside the
walls for purposes of intrigue. All round the north
and east of the city the people could step out of the
gates into the country. Except the houses of Bishopsgate
Without and the Whitechapel Road, there
was nothing but fields and open ground. Around
St. Giles, Cripplegate, however, we find a suburb already
populous. About Smithfield the houses gather
thickly. We observe the familiar names of Little
Britain, Pye Corner, Cock Lane, and Hoosier Lane.
Holborn, with gardens on the north, has a double line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
of houses as far as Chancery Lane. Where is now
Blackfriars Bridge Road stood the palace of Bridewell,
with its two square courts and its gabled front facing
the river. Whitefriars is partly built upon, but some
of the courts and gardens remain. The lawns of the
Temple, planted with elms, slope down to the river,
and these were followed westward by the palaces
along the Strand&mdash;Exeter House, Arundel House, the
Bishop of Llandaff's house, Somerset House, the Savoy,
Bedford House, Cecil House, Northumberland
House, and the rest, of which Somerset House alone
remains, and that in altered guise. There are no
docks as yet. The lading and the unlading of the
ships continued almost until this century to be done
in the Pool below London Bridge by barges and
lighters.</p>

<p>In considering the people of London in the time of
good Queen Bess one is forced to put the poets and
dramatists first, because they are the chief glory of
this wonderful reign. Yet such a harvest could only
spring from a fruitful soil. Of such temper as were
the poets, so also&mdash;so courageous, so hopeful, so confident&mdash;were
the inarticulate mass for whom they
sang and spoke. Behind Kit Marlowe, Greene, and
Peele were the turbulent youth, prodigal of life, eager
for joy, delighting in feast and song, always ready for
a fight, extravagant in speech and thought, jubilant in
their freedom from the tyranny of the Church. Behind
Spenser and Sydney were the cultivated class,
whose culture has never been surpassed. Behind
Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Massenger, and Beaumont,
and the rest were the people of all conditions, from
Gloriana herself down to Bardolph and Doll. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span>
can only get at the people through those who write
about them. Therefore we must needs say something
about the Elizabethan poets.</p>

<p>Fortunately there are plenty of them. In proportion
to the population, far, very far more than we
have even at the present day, when every year the
reviews find it necessary to cry out over the increasing
tide of new books. Of poets, in what other age
could the historian enumerate forty of the higher and
nearly two hundred of the lower rank? Of the forty,
most are well remembered and read even to the present
day; for instance, Chapman, Giles and Phineas
Fletcher, Robert Greene, Marston, Sackville, Sylvester,
Donne, Drayton, Drummond, Gascoigne, Marlowe, Raleigh,
Spenser, Wither, may be taken as poets still
read and loved, while the list does not include Shakespeare
and the dramatists. Nearly two hundred and
forty poets! Why, with a population of a hundred
millions of English-speaking people now in the world,
we have not a half or a sixth of that number, while in
the same proportion we should have to equal in number
the Elizabethan singers&mdash;about 5000. But in that
age every gentleman wrote verse; the cultivation of
poetry was like the cultivation of music. Every man
could play an instrument; every man could take his
part in a glee or madrigal; so, also, every man could
turn his set of verses, with the result of a fine and
perfect flower of poetry which has never been surpassed.</p>

<p>But they were not only poets. They had every
kind of literature in far greater abundance, considering
the small number of educated people, than exists
in our own time, and in as great variety. Consider!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span>
There are now scattered over the whole world a hundred
millions of English-speaking people, of whom at
least five-sixths read something, if it is only a penny
newspaper, and at least a half read books of some
kind. In Elizabeth's reign there were about six millions,
of whom more than half could not read at all.
The reading public of Great Britain and Ireland, considered
with regard to numbers, resembled what is
now found in Holland, Norway, or Denmark. Yet
from so small a people came this mass of literature,
great, varied, and immortal.</p>

<p>In the matter of fiction alone they were already
rich. There were knightly books: the <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>,
the <i>Seven Champions</i>, <i>Amadis of Gaul</i>, <i>Godfrey of
Bouillon</i>, <i>Palmerin of England</i>, and many more. There
were story-books, as the <i>Seven Wise Masters</i>, the <i>Gesta
Romanorum</i>, the <i>Amorous Fiammetta</i>, the jest books
of Skogin, Tarleton, Hobson, Skelton, Peele, and others.
There was the famous <i>Euphues</i>, Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i>,
all the pastoral romances, and the "picaresque"
novels of Nash and Dekker. Then there were the
historians and chroniclers, as Stow, Camden, Speed,
Holinshed; the essayists, as Sir Thomas Browne,
Ascham, Bacon; the theologians, of whom there were
hundreds; the satirists, as Bishop Hall and Marston;
the writers of what we should call light literature&mdash;Greene,
Nash, Peele, and Dekker. And there were
translations, as from the Italian, Boccaccio, Ariosto,
Biondello, Tasso, and others; from the French, Froissart,
Montaigne, Plutarch (Amyot), the <i>Cent Nouvelles
Nouvelles</i> (in the <i>Hundred Merry Tales</i>), and the stories
of the <i>Forest</i> and the <i>Palace of Pleasure</i>. And
there were all the dramatists. Never before or since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
has the country been better supplied with new literature
and good books.</p>

<p>Remember, again, everything was new. All the
books were new; the printing-press was new; you
could almost count the volumes that had been issued.
It was reckoned a great thing for Dr. Dee to have
three thousand printed books. Every scholar found
a classic which had not been translated, and took him
in hand. Every traveller brought home some modern
writer, chiefly Italian, previously unknown. Every
sailor brought home the record of a voyage to unknown
seas and to unknown shores. It was a time
when the world had become suddenly conscious of a
vast, an inconceivable widening, the results of which
could not yet be foretold. But the knowledge filled
men with such hopes as had never before been experienced.
Scholars and poets, merchants and sailors,
rovers and adventurers, all alike were moved by the
passion and ecstasy of the time. Strange time! Wonderful
time! We who read the history of that time too
often confine our attention to the political history. We
are able, with the help of Froude, quite clearly to understand
the perplexities and troubles of the Maiden
Queen; we see her, in her anxiety, playing off Spaniard
against Frenchman, to avoid destruction should
they act together. But the people know and suspect
none of these things. State affairs are too high for
them. They only see the brightness of the sky and
the promise of the day; they only feel the quickening
influence of the spring; their blood is fired; they
have got new hopes, a new faith, new openings, new
learning. And they bear themselves accordingly.
That is to say, with extravagances innumerable, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
confidence and courage lofty, unexampled. Why, it
fires the blood of this degenerate time only to think
of the mighty enlargement of that time. When one
considers when they lived and what they talked, one
understands Kit Marlowe and Robert Greene, and
that wild company of scholars and poets; they would
cram into whatever narrow span of life was granted
them all&mdash;all&mdash;all&mdash;that life can give of learning and
poetry, and feasting and love and joy. They were
intoxicated with the ideas of their time. They were
weighed down with the sheaves&mdash;the golden harvest
of that wondrous reaping. Who would not live in
such a time? The little world had become, almost
suddenly, very large, inconceivably large. The boys
of London, playing about the river stairs and the
quays, listened to the talk of men who had sailed
along those newly-discovered coasts of the new great
world, and had seen strange monsters and wild people.
In the taverns men&mdash;bearded, bronzed, scarred&mdash;grave
men, with deep eyes and low voice, who had sailed to
the Guinea coast, round the Cape to Hindostan, across
the Spanish Main, over the ocean to Virginia, sat in
the tavern and told to youths with flushed cheeks and
panting, eager breath queer tales of danger and escape
between their cups of sack. We were not yet
advanced beyond believing in the Ethiopian with
four eyes, the Arimaspi with one eye, the Hippopodes
or Centaurs, the Monopoli, or men who have no head,
but carry their faces in their breasts and their eyes in
their shoulders. None of these monsters, it is true,
had ever been caught and brought home; but many
an honest fellow, if hard pressed by his hearers, would
reluctantly confess to having seen them. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">{285}</a></span>
other hand, negroes and red Indians were frequently
brought home and exhibited. And there were crocodiles,
alive or stuffed; crocodiles' skins, the skins of
bears and lions, monkeys, parrots, flying-fish dried,
and other curious things. And there were always the
legends&mdash;that of the land of gold, the Eldorado; that
of the kingdom of Prester John; that of St. Brandan's
Island; and, but this was later, the theory&mdash;proved
with mathematical certainty&mdash;of the great southern
continent. Enough, and more than enough, to inflame
the imagination of adventurers, to drive the
lads aboard ship, to make them long for the sails to
be spread and to be making their way anywhere&mdash;anywhere&mdash;in
search of adventure, conquest, glory,
and gold.</p>

</div>

<p>Such an enlargement, such hopes, can never again
return to the world. That is impossible, save on one
chance. We cannot make the world any wider; by
this time we know it nearly all; the pristine mystery&mdash;the
awfulness of the unknown&mdash;has wellnigh gone
out of every land, even New Guinea and Central
Africa. Yet there is this one chance. Science may
and will widen the world&mdash;for her own disciples&mdash;in
many new and unexpected ways. The sluggish imagination
of the majority is little touched even by such
marvels as the electric telegraph, the phonograph, the
telephone. For them science in any form cannot enlarge
their boundaries. Suppose, however, a thing to
be achieved which should go right home to the comprehension,
brain, and heart of every living man. Suppose
that science should prevent, conquer, and annihilate
disease. Suppose our span of life enlarged to two
hundred, three hundred, five hundred years, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">{286}</a></span>
suddenly. Think of the wild exaltations, the extravagances,
the prodigalities, the omnivorous attempts of
the scholar, the universal grasp of the physicist, the
amazing and audacious experiments of chemist, electrician,
biologist, and the long reach of the statesman!
Think of these things, I say, and remember that in the
age of Elizabeth, of Raleigh, Drake, Marlowe, Nash,
Greene, Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Spenser, Bacon, and
the rest similar causes produced similar effects.</p>

<hr style='margin-left:27.5%; width:45%'/>

<p>We have seen the development of the mediæval
house from the simple common hall. The Elizabethan
house shows an immense advance in architecture. I
believe that the noblest specimen now remaining is
Burghley House in Northamptonshire, built by Cecil,
Lord Burghley and first Earl of Exeter. The house
is built about a square court. The west front has a
lofty square tower. Let us, with Burghley House before
us, read what Bacon directs as to building. The
front, he says, must have a tower, with a wing on either
side. That on the right was to consist of nothing but
a "goodly room of some forty feet high"&mdash;he does not
give the length&mdash;"and under it a room for dressing or
preparing place at times of triumphs." By triumphs
he means pageants, mummings, and masques. "On
the other side, which is the household side, I wish it
divided at the first into a hall and a chapel (with a
partition between), both of good state and bigness.
And these not to go all the length, but to have at the
further end a winter and a summer parlor, both fair."
Here are to be the cellars, kitchens, butteries, and
pantries. "Beyond this front is to be a fair court,
but three sides of it of a far lower building than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
front. And in all the four corners of the court fair
staircases, cast into turrets on the outside, and not
within the row of buildings themselves.... Let the
court not be paved, for that striketh up a great heat
in summer and much cold in winter. But only some
side alleys with a cross, and the quarters to graze
being kept shorn, but not too near shorn." Stately galleries
with colored windows are to run along the banquet
side; on the household side, "chambers of presence
and ordinary entertainments, with bedchambers."
Beyond this court is to be a second of the same square,
with a garden and a cloister. Other directions he
gives which, if they were carried out, would make a
very fine house indeed. But these we may pass over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
In short, Bacon's idea of a good house was much like
a college. That of Clare, Cambridge, for instance,
would have been considered by Bacon as a very good
house indeed, though the arrangement of the banqueting-room
was not exactly as the philosopher would
have it. The College of Christ's in its old form, with
the garden square beyond, was still more after the
manner recommended by Bacon.</p>

<img src="images/page_287.jpg" width="535" height="354" alt="ILFORD ALMSHOUSES" title="" />
<span class="caption">ILFORD ALMSHOUSES</span>
</div>

<p>It will be seen that we are now a good way removed
from the Saxon Hall with the people sleeping
on the floor, yet Bacon's house lineally descends from
that beginning. All the old houses in London were
built in this way, as may be illustrated by many
which retain the old form, as well as by those which
remain. Hampton Court, for instance, built by Wolsey;
Northumberland House, recently taken down;
Gresham House, taken down a hundred years ago;
Somerset House, still standing, though much altered;
the old Navy Office, the court of which still remains;
some of the old almshouses, notably Trinity Almshouse,
in the Whitechapel Road; Emanuel, Westminster;
and the Norfolk Hospital, Greenwich, Gray's
Inn, Clifford's Inn, Staple Inn, Barnard's Inn&mdash;which
contains the oldest house in London&mdash;are admirable
specimens of Bacon's house; while in the old taverns,
of which a few imperfect specimens still exist, we
have the galleries which Bacon would construct within
his court.</p>

<p>In the reign of Elizabeth, while the merchants were
growing richer and increasing in number and in
wealth, the great nobles were gradually leaving the
city. Those who remained kept up but a remnant of
their former splendor. Elizabeth refused license for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">{289}</a></span>
the immense number of retainers formerly allowed;
she would suffer a hundred at the most. It was a
time rather for the rise of new families than the continued
greatness of the old. The nobles, as they went
away, sold their London houses to the citizens. Thus
Winchester House and Crosby Hall went to merchants;
Derby House to the College of Heralds;
Cold Harbor was pulled down in 1590, and its site
built over with tenements; the Duke of Norfolk's
house, on the site of Holy Trinity Priory, was shortly
after destroyed, and the place assigned to the newly-arrived
colony of Jews. Barnard's Castle alone among
the city palaces remained in the possession of a great
noble until the fire came and swept it away.</p>

<span class="caption">OLD TAVERN</span>
</div>

<p>Great beyond all precedent was the advance of
trade in this golden age. Elizabeth was wise and
wisely advised in the treatment of the City and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">{290}</a></span>
merchants. Perhaps she followed the example of
King Edward the Fourth. Perhaps she remembered
(but this I doubt) that she belonged to the City by
her mother's side, for her great-grandfather, Sir Geoffrey
Boleyn, had been Lord Mayor a hundred years
before her accession. But the rapid growth of London
trade seems to me chiefly due to the wisdom of
one man&mdash;Sir Thomas Gresham.</p>

<p>This great man, even more than Whittington, is the
typical London merchant. Not a self-made man at
all, but coming of a good old country stock&mdash;always
a master, always of the class which commands. Nearly
all the great London merchants have, as has already
been stated, belonged to that class. His family came
originally from Gresham, in Norfolk; his father, Sir
Richard, was Lord Mayor; his uncle, Sir John, also
Lord Mayor, saved Bethlehem Hospital at the dissolution
of the religious houses. Not a poor and friendless
lad, by any means; from the outset he had every
advantage that wealth and station can afford. He
was educated at Gonville (afterwards Gonville and
Caius) College, Cambridge. It was not until he had
taken his degree that he was apprenticed to his uncle,
and he was past twenty-four when he was received
into the Mercers' Company.</p>

<p>When he was thirty-two years of age a thing happened
to Thomas Gresham which proved to be the
most fortunate chance that ever came to the City of
London. He was appointed Royal Agent at Antwerp.
The King's loans were at that time always offered
at Antwerp or Bruges, and were taken up by
merchants of the Low Countries at the enormous interest
of 14 per cent. Sometimes a part of the advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">{293}</a></span>
had to take the form of jewels. At this time
the annual interest on the debt amounted to £40,000;
and while the exchange was sixteen Flemish shillings
to the pound sterling, the agent had to pay in English
money. The post, therefore, was not an easy one to
fill.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 458px;"><a name="FRONT_OF_SIR_PAUL_PINDER39S_HOUSE_ON_THE_WEST_SIDE_OF_BISHOPSGATE_STREET" id="FRONT_OF_SIR_PAUL_PINDER39S_HOUSE_ON_THE_WEST_SIDE_OF_BISHOPSGATE_STREET"></a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a></span>

<span class="caption">FRONT OF SIR PAUL PINDER&#39;S HOUSE, ON THE WEST SIDE OF BISHOPSGATE STREET
WITHOUT</span>
</div>

<p>Gresham, however, reduced the interest from 14 per
cent. to 12, or even 10 per cent. He suppressed the
jewels, and took the whole of the loan in money; and
he continued to enjoy the confidence of Edward's
ministers, of Queen Mary, and of Queen Elizabeth.
In order to effect this, he must have been a most able
and honest servant, or else a most supple courtier.
He was the former. Now, had he done nothing more
than played the part of Royal Agent better than any
one who went before him, he might have been as
much forgotten as his predecessors. But he did much
more. The City owes to Gresham a debt of gratitude
impossible to be repaid. This is a foolish sentence,
because gratitude can never be repaid. You may always
entertain and nourish gratitude, and you can do
service in return, but gratitude remains. A great service
once received is a possession forever, and generally
a fruitful and growing possession.</p>

<p>When Queen Elizabeth ascended the throne the
commercial centre of the world was Antwerp; when
she died, the commercial centre of the world was
London. This transfer had been effected by the wisdom
and foresight of one man taking advantage of
the times and their chances. The religious wars of
the Netherlands brought immense losses to Antwerp.
These losses Gresham desired to make London's gains.
But he was met with the initial difficulty that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">{294}</a></span>
merchants of London had not yet learned to act together.
They had, it is true, the old trading company
of merchant adventurers, but that stood alone; besides,
its ambitions were modest. They had no experience
in union; there was no central institution which
should be the city's brain, the place where the merchants
could meet and receive news and consult together.
Now, at Antwerp there was a goodly Bourse.
What if London could also have its Bourse?</p>

<p>Well, Gresham built a Bourse; he gave it to the
city; he formed this place of meeting for the merchants;
the Queen opened it, and called it the Royal
Exchange. The possession of the Exchange was followed
immediately by such a development of enterprise
as had been unknown before in the history of
the City. Next he persuaded the citizens to take up
the Queen's loans themselves, so that the interest, at
12 per cent., should remain in the country. He showed
his own people how to take advantage of Antwerp's
disasters and to divert her trade to the port of London.
As for his Bourse, it stood on the site of the
present Royal Exchange, but the front was south in
Cornhill. The west front was blocked up by houses.
The building was of brick and mortar, three stories
high, with dormer windows in the high-pitched roof.
At every corner was a pinnacle surmounted by a
grasshopper&mdash;the Gresham crest. On the south side
rose a lofty tower with a bell, which called the merchants
together at noon in the morning and at six in
the evening. Within was an open court surrounded
by covered walks, adorned with statues of kings, behind
which were shops rented by milliners, haberdashers,
and sellers of trifles. This was the lower pawne.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">{295}</a></span>
Above, in the upper pawne, there were armorers,
apothecaries, book-sellers, goldsmiths, and glass-sellers.
The Bourse was opened by Queen Elizabeth on January
23, 1571. She changed its name from the Bourse
to the Royal Exchange. When it was destroyed in
the fire of 1666, it was observed that all the statues
were destroyed, except that of Gresham himself.</p>

<span class="caption">THE ROYAL EXCHANGE, CORNHILL</span>
</div>

<p>To illustrate this increase in English trade, we have
these facts: In the reign of Edward VI., a time of
great decay, there were few Merchant Adventurers
and hardly any English ships. When Elizabeth began
to reign there were no more than 317 merchants
in all, of whom the Company of Mercers formed
ninety-nine. Before her reign it was next to impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">{296}</a></span>
for the city to raise a loan of £10,000. Before
she died the city was advancing to the Queen loans
of £60,000. Before her reign the only foreign trade
was a venture or two into Russia; everything came
across from Antwerp and Sluys. During her reign
the foreign trade was developed in an amazing manner.
New commodities were exported, as beer and
sea coal, a great many new things were introduced&mdash;new
trades, new luxuries. For instance, apricots, turkeys,
hops, tobacco were brought over and planted
and naturalized. Fans, ladies' wigs, fine knives, pins,
needles, earthen fire-pots, silk and crystal buttons,
shoe-buckles, glass-making, nails, paper were made in
this country for the first time. The Merchant Adventurers,
who had been incorporated under Edward I.,
obtained fresh rights and larger powers; they obtained
the abolition of the privileges enjoyed for three hundred
years by the Hanseatic merchant; they established
courts at Antwerp, Dordrecht, and Hamburg;
they had houses at York, Hull, and Newcastle. Further,
when we read that they exported wine, oil, silks,
and fruits, in addition to the products of the country,
it is clear that they had already obtained some of the
carrying trade of the world. Of the trading companies
founded under Elizabeth and her successors, only
one now survives. Yet the whole trade of this country
was created by these companies.</p>

<p>Who, for instance, now remembers the Eastland
Company, or Merchants of Elbing? Yet they had a
long existence as a company; and long after their
commercial life was gone they used to elect their officers
every year, and hold a feast. Perhaps they do
still. Their trade was with the Baltic. Or the Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">{297}</a></span>
Company? That sprang out of a company called
the "Merchant Adventurers for the Discovery of
Lands not before known to or frequented by the
English."</p>

<p>This company sent out Sir Hugh Willoughby, with
three ships, to find a north-east passage to China.
But Sir Hugh was forced to put in at a port in Russian
Lapland, where he and all his men were frozen
to death. The Russian Company became whalers,
and quarrelled with the Dutch over the fishing. It
had a checkered career, and finally died, but, like the
Eastland Company, it continued to elect officers and
to dine together long after its work was over. Or the
Turkey Company, which lasted from 1586 to 1825,
when it dissolved? Or the Royal African Company,
which lived from 1530 to 1821? There were, also,
the Merchants of Spain; the French Merchants; the
Merchants of Virginia; the East India Company, the
greatest and most powerful of any trading company
ever formed; the Hudson Bay Company, which still
exists; the South Sea Company; the Guinea Company;
the Canary Company. Some of these belong to
a later period, but they speak of the spirit of the enterprise
and adventure first awakened under Elizabeth.</p>

<p>In the Church of St. Martin Outwich, now pulled
down, was a monument to the chief actor in the promotion
of these trading companies. "Here," said
the tombstone, "resteth the body of the worshipful
Mr. Richard Staple, elected Alderman of this city
1584. He was the greatest Merchant in his time; the
chiefest Actor in the Discovery of the Trade of Turkey
and East India; a man humble in prosperity,
painful and ever ready in affairs public, and discreetly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">{298}</a></span>
careful of his private. A liberal house-keeper, bountiful
to the Poor, an upright dealer in the world, and a
devout inquirer after the world to come.... <i>Intravit
ut exiret.</i>"</p>

<p>The increase of trade had another side. It was accompanied
by protection, with the usual results. "In
the old days," says Harrison, "when strange bottoms
were suffered to come in, we had sugar for fourpence
the pound that now is worth half a crown; raisins
and currants for a pennie that now are holden at sixpence,
and sometimes at eightpence and tenpence, the
pound; nutmegs at twopence halfpenny the ounce;
ginger at a pennie the ounce; prunes at a halfpenny
farthing; great raisins, three pound for a pennie; cinnamon
at fourpence the ounce; cloves at twopence;
and pepper at twelve or sixteen pence the pound."
He does not state the increase in price of the latter
articles; but if we are to judge by that of sugar, the
increase of trade was not an unmixed blessing to
those whose incomes had not advanced with equal
step.</p>

<p>The city associated the new prosperity with their
Maiden Queen, for whom their love and loyalty never
abated in the least. When she asked them for a certain
number of ships they sent double the number,
fully manned and provided; when the Queen's enemy,
Mary of Scotland, was beheaded, they rang their bells
and made bonfires; while the Queen was living they
thanked God solemnly for her long reign; when she
died, their lamentations were loud and sincere; her
monument, until the fire, adorned many of the city
churches. One of the Elizabeth statues yet remains
outside the Church of St. Dunstan's, Fleet Street. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">{301}</a></span>
is the statue which formerly stood on the west side
of Lud Gate.</p>

<p>To return to Gresham. He not only gave the city
a Bourse, but he also endowed it with a college, which
should have been a rival of Trinity or Christ Church
but for the mismanagement which reduced it for a
long time to the level of a lecture institute. The idea
of the founder will, no doubt, be revived some time
or other, and Gresham College will become a place of
learning worthy of the city.</p>

<p>The career of Sir Thomas Gresham strangely resembles
that of Whittington. Both were favorites
with successive sovereigns. If Gresham built an Exchange,
Whittington, by his will, added to Guildhall;
if Gresham founded a college for the London youth,
Whittington founded a college for priests, and an
almshouse; if Gresham restored the finances of his
sovereign, Whittington gave back to his the bonds of
all his debts. Both were mercers; both merchant adventurers;
both kept a shop; both were of good descent.</p>

<p>Gresham's shop was in Lombard Street, at the Sign
of the Grasshopper, his family crest. His shop contained
gold and silver vessels; coins, ancient and
modern; gold chains, gold and silver lace, rings, and
jewels. He lent money, as most bankers do, on security,
but he got 10 and 12 per cent. for it. He had
correspondents abroad, and he gave travellers letters
of credit; he bought foreign coin either to exchange
or to melt down. And he lived in his own house,
over his shop, until he was knighted, when he built a
new house between Bishopsgate Street and Broad
Street. Stow calls it "the most spacious of all thereabout;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">{302}</a></span>
builded of brick and timber." This house became
afterwards Gresham College.</p>

<p>Again, this was a great age for the foundation of
grammar-schools. The education of London in the
Middle Ages is a subject which has never yet been
adequately treated. We know very well what was
taught at the universities. But what did the merchant
learn, the shopkeeper, the craftsman? To what school
was the boy sent before he was apprenticed? There
was a school, it is said, to every religious house. I
think that latterly the monastic school was kept up
with about as much sincerity as the monastic rule of
poverty. Stow certainly says that when Henry V.
dissolved the alien priories, their schools perished as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">{303}</a></span>
well. On the other hand, consider the great number
of religious houses in and around London. There
should have been schools enough for the whole population.
Yet Henry VI. founded four grammar-schools
"besides St. Paul's," viz., at St. Martin's le Grand,
St. Mary le Bow, St. Dunstan's in the west, and St.
Anthony's. Why did he do this if there were already
plenty of schools? And observe that one of his foundations
was at a religious house&mdash;St. Martin's. The
year after he created four more schools&mdash;at St. Anthony's
(Holborn), All Hallows the Great, St. Peter's
(Cornhill), and St. Thomas of Acon. All these schools
perished in the Reformation, with the exception of
St. Paul's and St. Anthony's. Why they perished,
unless they were endowed with property belonging to
some monastic house, is not clear.</p>

<p>For a time the city had no schools, no hospitals, no
foundations for the poor, the sick, or the aged. These
grievous losses were speedily amended. St. Paul's
was presently newly founded by Dean Colet. The
Blue-Coat School arose on the ruins of the Grey Friars.
The Mercers' Company continued the School of
St. Thomas as their own, and it still exists. The Merchant
Taylors founded their school, which is now at
the Charterhouse. At St. Olave's and St. Saviour's
schools were established. A few years later was
founded the Charterhouse School, which is now removed
to Godalming.</p>

<p>In these narrow limits it is impossible to reproduce
much of the Elizabethan daily life. Here, however,
are certain details.</p>

<p>The ordering of the household was strict. Servants
and apprentices were up at six in the summer and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">{304}</a></span>
seven in the winter. No one, on any pretence, except
that of illness, was to absent himself from morning
and evening prayers; there was to be no striking, no
profane language. Sunday was clean-shirt day. Dinner
was at eleven, supper at six. There was no public
or private office which was not provided with a
Bible. In the better classes there was a general enthusiasm
for learning of all kinds. The ladies, imitating
the example of the Queen, practised embroidery,
wrote beautifully, played curious instruments, knew
how to sing in parts, dressed with as much magnificence
as they could afford, danced corantoes and lavoltas
as well as the simple hey, and studied languages&mdash;Latin,
Greek, and Italian. The last was the favorite
language. Many collected books. Dr. John Dee
had as many as four thousand, of which one thousand
were manuscripts. They were arranged on the shelves
with the leaves turned outward, not the backs. This
was to show the gilding, the gold clasps, and the silken
strings. The books were bound with great care
and cost; everybody knows the beauty of the type
used in the printing.</p>

<p>Tournaments were maintained until the end of
Elizabeth's reign. But we hear little of them, and it
is not likely that they retained much of their old popularity.
One Sir Henry Lee entered the tilt-yard
every year until age prevented him. They always
kept up the sport of tilting at the Quintain in the
water. But their favorite amusements were the pageant
and the play. The pageant came before the
play; and while the latter was performed on a rough
scaffold, in an inn-yard, the former was provided with
splendid dresses, music, songs, and properties of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">{305}</a></span>
kind. There were pageants for the reception of the
King when he made a procession into the City; there
were court pageants; there were private pageants in
great men's houses; there were pageants got up by
companies. The reception pageants, for instance, are
very well illustrated by that invented for Queen Elizabeth
on her visit to the city in the year 1558.</p>

<p>It was in January, but I think people felt cold
weather less in those days. The Queen came by water,
attended by the city barges, which were trimmed
with targets and banners of their mysteries, from
Westminster to the Tower, where she lay for two
days. She then rode through the City, starting at
two in the afternoon, when everybody had had dinner.</p>

<p>In Fenchurch Street there
was a scaffold, where was a
band of music, and a child
who presented the Queen
with a poetical address.</p>

<p>At the upper end of Gracechurch
Street a noble arch
had been erected, with a
triple stage. On the lowest
stood two children, representing
Henry VII. and Elizabeth
of York; on the second,
two more, for Henry
VIII. and Anne Boleyn;
and on the third, Queen
Elizabeth herself. Music
and a poetical address.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 210px;"><a name="CURIOUS_PUMP" id="CURIOUS_PUMP"></a>
<img src="images/page_305.jpg" width="210" height="286" alt="CURIOUS PUMP" title="" />
<span class="caption">CURIOUS PUMP</span>
</div>

<p>At Cornhill there was another pageant, representing
the Queen placed on a seat supported by four figures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">{306}</a></span>
viz., Religion, Wisdom, Justice, and Love, each of
which was treading under foot the opposite vice.
Music and a poetical address.</p>

<p>At the entrance of Cheapside a third pageant represented
the eight beatitudes.</p>

<p>At the Conduit a fourth pageant displayed two
mountains; one, ragged and stony, with a withered
tree, under which sat one in homely garb; over her
head was a tablet with the legend, "Respublica ruinosa."
The other hill was fair and green, with a flourishing
tree, and the words, "Respublica bene instituta."
Between the hills was a cave, out of which
issued Time, with his wings, scythe, and forelock
quite complete, leading a maiden in white silk, on
whose head was written <i>Temporis Filia</i>, and on her
breast <i>Veritas</i>. This fair damsel held a Bible in her
hand, which she let down by a silken thread to the
Queen.</p>

<p>At the Conduit in Fleet Street they had erected a
stage with four towers, on which was a throne under
a palm-tree. On the throne sat Deborah, "Judge and
Restorer of the House of Israel." On the steps of
the throne stood six personages, two of them representing
the nobility, two the clergy, and two the commons.
At Temple Bar they had two giants, Gogmagog
and Albion, and Corineus, the Briton. On the
south side was a "noise" of singing children, one of
whom, attired as a poet, bade the Queen farewell in
the name of the City.</p>

<p>The court pageants may be understood by reading
the masques of Ben Jonson. Everything costly,
splendid, and precious was lavished upon these shows.
Everything that machinery could contrive was devised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">{307}</a></span>
for them. Ben Jonson himself, speaking of the
performance of his "Hymenæa," says: "Such was
the exquisite performance, as, besides the pomp,
splendor, or what we may call apparelling of such presentments,
that alone, had all else been absent, was of
power to surprise with delight, and steal away the
spectators from themselves. Nor was there wanting
whatsoever might give to the furniture or complement,
either in riches, or strangeness of the habits, delicacy
of dances, magnificence of the scene, or divine rapture
of musick. Only the envy was that it lasted not still."</p>

<p>It was not until 1570 that the first theatre was built.
The popularity of the play had already begun to grow
with amazing rapidity. In twenty years there were
five theatres, with performances every day. The
Queen had four companies of children trained to perform,
viz., the children of St. Paul's, the children of
the chapel, the children of Westminster, and the children
of Windsor. The public actors, too, were often
called upon to perform before the Queen.</p>

<p>These companies were: Lord Leicester's company,
Sir Robert Lane's, Lord Clinton's, Lord Warwick's,
the Lord Chamberlain's, the Earl of Sussex's, Lord
Howard's, the Earl of Essex's, Lord Strange's, the
Earl of Derby's, the Lord Admiral's, the Earl of
Hertford's, and Lord Pembroke's. It is not supposed
that all these companies existed at the same time;
but the list shows how company after company was
begun and maintained on the credit of some great
lord.</p>

<p>The theatres at the end of the sixteenth century
were seven in number&mdash;the Globe, at Bankside; the
Red Bull, in St. John Street; the Curtain, in Shoreditch;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">{308}</a></span>
the Fortune, in Whitecross Street. These four
were public theatres. The other three were called
private houses&mdash;the Blackfriars, the Whitefriars, and
the Cockpit or Ph&oelig;nix Theatre. In the next chapter
we shall assist at a matinee of one of Shakespeare's
plays.</p>

<p>But the people lost no opportunity of "making up,"
acting, and dancing. The pageant became more and
more a play. There were pageants of more or less
splendor&mdash;we all know the great pageants of Kenilworth&mdash;held
in every great man's house, in every
company's hall, and in private persons' houses, to
mark every possible occasion. Thus, in the year 1562,
on July 20, took place the marriage of one Coke, citizen
(but of what company I know not)&mdash;was he a
cousin of Edward Coke, afterwards Speaker?&mdash;with
the daughter of Mr. Nicolls, master of London Bridge.
My Lord Mayor and all the Aldermen, with many
ladies and other worshipful men and women, were
present at the wedding. Mr. Bacon, an eminent divine,
preached the wedding sermon. After the discourse
the company went home to the Bridge House
to dinner, where was as good cheer as ever was known&mdash;Stow
says so, and he knew very well&mdash;with all manner
of music and dancing, and at night a masque till
midnight. But this was only half the feast, for next
day the wedding was again kept at the Bridge House
with great cheer. After supper more mumming, after
that more masques. One was in cloth of gold, the
next consisted of friars, and the third of nuns. First
the friars and the nuns danced separately, one company
after the other, and then they danced together.
Considering that it was only two years since the friars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">{309}</a></span>
and the nuns had been finally suppressed, there must
have been a certain piquancy in this dance. It is always,
at such times, put on the stage. One of the
first things, for instance, done in Madrid when Spain
got her short-lived republic was that in every <i>café
chantant</i> they put a friar and a nun on the stage to
dance and sing together.</p>

<p>They still kept the saint's day of their company; in
fact, when the old faith was suppressed the people
willingly endured a change of doctrine so long as they
were not called upon to give up their feasting, which
was exactly what had happened in Italy and elsewhere
when the people were induced or forced to become
Christians. They made no objection to doctrine, provided
their practice was not interfered with. Therefore
the Protestant citizens kept up their Whitsun
ales, their wakes, their Easter and Christmas feastings.
All the saints' days which brought something better
than ordinary to eat, with morris dances, May-poles,
bonfires, music, and Feasts of Misrule were religiously
conserved. As to the Feast of Misrule, hear the testimony
of the contemporary moralist:</p>

<p>"Thus all things set in order, then have they their
hobby-horses, their dragons, and other antiques, together
with their pipers and thundering drummers, to
strike up the Devil's Dance. Thus march this merry
company towards the church and church-yard, their
pipers piping, their drummers thundering, their stumpes
dancing, their bells jingling, their handkerchiefs fluttering
about their heads like madmen, their hobby-horses
and other monsters skirmishing among the
throng, and in this sort they go to the church like
devils incarnate, with such a confused noise that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">{310}</a></span>
man can hear his own voice. Then the foolish people&mdash;they
look, they stare, they laugh, they cheer, they
mount upon forms and pews to see the goodly pageants
solemnized in this sort. Then, after this, about
the church they go again and again, and so forth into
the church-yard, where they have commonly their
summer halls, their bowers, arbors, and banqueting-houses
set up, wherein they feast, banquet, and dance
all that day, and, peradventure, all that night too."</p>

<p>To keep a troop of servants has always been a mark
of state. Ladies used to beat their servants&mdash;following
the example of the Queen, who sometimes boxed
the ears of her courtiers. Everybody of position travelled,
and nearly everybody went to Italy, with results
disastrous to religion and to morals. One of the
worst figures in the Elizabethan gallery is the Englishman
Italianized. Of course on his return the traveller
gave himself strange airs. How they travelled
and what they saw may be read in that most charming
book, the <i>Epistolæ Hoellianæ</i>.</p>

<p>Card-playing and gaming were the commonest form
of amusement. The games were <i>primero</i>, which Falstaff
foreswore, trump, <i>gleek</i>, <i>gresco</i>, new cut, knave
out-of-doors, ruff, noddy, post and pace&mdash;all of these
games corresponding, no doubt, to those still played.</p>

<p>Another favorite amusement was dancing in all its
various forms, from the stately court dance to the
merry circle on the village green. The principal
dances were the solemn <i>pavane</i>, the <i>brawl</i>, the <i>Passamezzo
galliard</i>, the <i>Canary dance</i>, the <i>coranto</i>, the <i>lavolta</i>,
the <i>jig</i>, the <i>galliard</i>, the <i>fancy</i>, and the <i>hey</i>.</p>

<p>Gentlemen were followed in the streets by their
servants, who carried their master's sword. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">{311}</a></span>
dress was blue, with the master's badge in silver on
the left arm.</p>

<p>The pages of Stow, Harrison, Hall, Greene, and
Nash contain not only glimpses, but also set pictures
of the time, from which extracts by the hundred
might be made. There are the awful examples, for
instance, of Sir John Champneys, Alderman and Lord
Mayor, and Richard Wethell, citizen and tailor. Both
these persons built high towers to their houses to
show their pride and to look down upon their neighbors&mdash;one
is reminded of the huge leaning towers in
Bologna. What happened? The first went blind, so
that though he might climb his tower he could see
nothing. The second was afflicted with gout in hands
and feet, so that he could not walk, much less climb
his tower. Stubbes has other instances of judgments,
particularly the terrible fate of the girl who invoked
the devil to help her with her ruff.</p>

<p>Here is a curious little story. It happened in the
reign of King James. One day, in Bishopsgate Ward,
a poor man, named Richard Atkinson, going to remove
a heap of sea-coal ashes in his wheelbarrow, discovered
lying in the ashes the body of a newly-born
child. It was still breathing, and he carried it to his
wife, who washed and fed it and restored it to life.
The child was a goodly and well-formed boy, strong
and well-featured, without blemish or harm upon it.
They christened the child at St. Helen's Church, by a
name which should cause him to remember, all through
his life, his very remarkable origin. They called him,
in fact, Job Cinere Extractus. A noble name, for the
sake of which alone he should have lived. What an
ancestor to have had! How delightful to be a Cinere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">{312}</a></span>
Extractus! Who would not wish to belong to such a
family, and to point to the ash-heap as the origin of
the first Cinere Extractus? Nothing like it in history
since the creation of Adam himself. What a coat of
arms! A shield azure, an ash-heap proper, with supporters
of two dustmen with shovels; crest a sieve;
motto, like that of the Courtenays, "from what heights
descended?" But alas! poor little Job Cinere Extractus
died three days afterwards, and now lies buried
in St. Helen's church-yard, without even a monument.</p>

<p>Another baby story&mdash;but this belongs to Charles I.'s
time&mdash;it happened, in fact, in the last month of that
melancholy reign. It was seven o'clock in the evening.
A certain ship-chandler became suddenly so
foolish as to busy himself over a barrel of gunpowder
with a candle. Naturally a spark fell into the barrel,
and he was not even left time enough to express his
regrets. Fifty houses were wrecked. How many
were killed no one could tell, but at the next house
but one, the Rose Tavern, there was a great company
holding the parish dinner, and they all perished. Next
morning, however, there was found on the leads of
All Hallows Barking a young child in a cradle as
newly laid in bed, neither child nor cradle having sustained
the least harm. It was never known who the
child was, but she was adopted by a gentleman of the
parish, and lived certainly to the age of seventeen,
when the historian saw her going to call her master,
who was drinking at a tavern. It is two hundred and
fifty years ago. That young woman may have at this
moment over a thousand descendants at least. Who
would not like to boast that she was his great-grandmother?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">{313}</a></span></p>

<p>A reform of vast importance, though at first it
seems a small thing, was introduced in this reign. It
was the restoration of vegetables and roots as part of
daily diet. Harrison is my authority. He says that
in old days&mdash;as in the time of the First Edward&mdash;herbs,
fruits, and roots were much used, but that from
Henry IV. to Henry VIII. the use of them decayed
and was forgotten. "Now," he says, "in my time
their use is not only resumed among the poore commons&mdash;I
mean of melons, pompines, gourds, cucumbers,
radishes, skirrets, parsneps, carrots, marrowes,
turnips, and all kinds of salad herbes&mdash;but they are
also looked upon as deintie dishes at the tables of
delicate merchants, gentlemen, and the nobilitie, who
make their provision yearly for new seeds out of
strange countries from whence they have them abundantly."</p>

<p>Perhaps the cause of the disuse of roots and vegetables
was the enormous rise in wages after the Black
Death, when the working-classes, becoming suddenly
rich, naturally associated roots with scarcity of beef,
and governed themselves accordingly.</p>

<p>The use of tobacco spread as rapidly, when once it
was introduced, as that of coffee later on. King James
speaks of those who spend as much as £300 a year
upon this noxious weed. Those who took tobacco
attributed to it all the virtues possible for any plant
to possess, and more.</p>

<p>It was the custom of the better sort of citizens to
have gardens outside the City, each with its own garden-house,
in some cases a mere arbor, but in others
a house for residence in the summer months. Moorfields
had many of these gardens, but Bethnal Green,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">{314}</a></span>
Hoxton (Hoggesden), and Mile End were favorite
spots for these retreats. Of course, the city madams
were accused of using these gardens as convenient
places for intrigue.</p>

<p>The education of girls was never so thorough as at
this time. Perhaps Lucy Hutchinson and Lady Jane
Grey&mdash;well-known cases&mdash;ought not to be taken as
average examples. The former, for instance, could
read at four, and at seven was under eight tutors, who
taught her languages, music, dancing, writing, and
needle-work. She also became a proficient in the art
of preparing simples and medicines. Of her husband
she says that he was a masterly player on the viol;
that he was a good marksman with gun and bow; and
that he was a collector of paintings and engravings.
Perhaps there was never a time when body and mind
were equally trained and developed as they were in
the sixteenth century. Think with what contempt
Sidney and Raleigh would regard an age like the present,
when the young men are trained to foot-ball, running,
and cricket, but, for the most part, cannot ride,
cannot shoot, cannot fence, cannot box, cannot wrestle,
cannot sing, cannot play any instrument, cannot
dance, and cannot make verses!</p>

<p>In the matter of rogues, vagabonds, and common
cheats, the age of Elizabeth shows no falling off, but
quite the reverse. We have little precise information
on English <i>ribauderie</i> before this time, but now, thanks
to John Awdely, Thomas Harman, Parson Hybesdrine,
Thomas Dekker, Robert Greene, and others, we learn
the whole art and mystery of coney-catching as practised
under the Tudor dynasty. The rogues had their
own language. No doubt they always had their language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">{315}</a></span>
as they have it now; and it varied from year
to year as it varies now, but the groundwork remained
the same, and, indeed, remains the same to this day.
The rogues and thieves, the beggars and the impostors,
are still with us. They are still accompanied by
their autem morts, their
walking morts, their Kynchen
morts, their doxies,
and their dolls, only
some of those cheats are
changed with the changes
of the time. Under Queen
Gloriana they abound in
every town and in every
street, they tramp along
all the roads, they haunt
the farm-houses, they rob
the market-women and
the old men. They have
their ranks and their precedency.
The Upright man is a captain among them;
the Curtall has authority over them; the Patriarch Co-marries
them until death do them part&mdash;that is to say,
until they pass a carcass of any creature, when, if they
choose, they shake hands and go separate ways. They
are well known by profession and name at every fair
throughout the country. They are Great John Gray
and Little John Gray; John Stradling with the shaking
head; Lawrence with the great leg; Henry Smyth,
who drawls when he speaks; that fine old gentleman,
Richard Horwood, who is eighty years of age and can
still bite a sixpenny nail asunder with his teeth, and a
notable toper still; Will Pellet, who carries the Kynchen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">{316}</a></span>
mort at his back; John Browne, the stammerer;
and the rest of them. They are all known; their
backs and shoulders are scored with the nine-tailed
cat; not a headborough or a constable but knows
them every one. Yet they forget their prison and
their whipping as soon as they are free. Those things
are the little drawbacks of the profession, against
which must be set freedom, no work, no masters, and
no duties. Who would not go upon the budge, even
though at the end there stands the three trees, up
which we shall have to climb by the ladder?</p>

<p>In the streets of London they separate and practise
each in the quarter most likely to catch the gull. For
instance, observe this well-dressed young gentleman,
with the simple manner and the honest face, strolling
along the middle-walk of Paul's. Simple as he looks,
his eye glances here and there among the throng.
Presently he sees a young countryman, whom he
knows by the unfailing signs; he approaches the countryman;
he speaks to him; in a few minutes they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">{317}</a></span>
leave the Cathedral together and betake them to a
tavern, where they dine, each paying for himself, in
amity and friendship, though strangers but an hour
since. Then comes into the tavern an ancient person,
somewhat decayed in appearance, who sits down and
calls for a stoup of ale. "Now," says the first young
man, "you shall see a jest, sir." Whereupon he accosts
the old gentleman, and presently proposes to
throw the dice for another pot. The old man accepts,
being a very simple and childlike old man, and loses&mdash;both
his money and his temper. Then the countryman
joins in.... After the young countryman gets
home, he learns that the old man was a "fingerer" by
profession, and that the young man was his confidant.</p>

<p>The courtesy man works where the sailors and sea-captains
congregate; he accosts one who looks credulous
and new; he tells him that he is one of a
company, tall, proper men, all like himself&mdash;he is well-mannered;
they are disbanded soldiers, masterless
and moneyless; for himself he would not beg, but for
his dear comrades he would do anything. When he
receives a shilling he puts it up with an air of contempt,
but accepts the donor's good-will, and thanks
him for so much. A plausible villain, this.</p>

<p>Outside Aldgate, where the Essex farmers are found,
the "ring faller" loves to practise his artless game.
Have we not still with us the man who picks up the
ring which he is willing to let us have for the tenth of
its value? The Elizabethan mariner, who has been
shipwrecked and lost his all, has vanished. The Tudor
disbanded soldier has vanished, but the army
reserve man sells his matches in the street when he
cannot find the work he looks for so earnestly; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">{318}</a></span>
counterfeit cranker who stood at the corner of the
street covered with mud, and his face besmeared with
blood, as one who has just had an attack of the falling
sickness, is gone, because that kind of sickness is
known no longer; the "frater" who carried a forged
license to beg for a hospital, is also gone; the abraham
man, who pretended to be mad, is gone; the
"palliard" or "clapper dodger;" the angler, who stuck
a hook in a long pole and helped himself out of the
open shops; the "prigger of prancers," a horse thief;
the ruffler, the swigman and prigman, are also gone,
but their descendants remain with us, zealous in the
pursuit of kindred callings, and watched over paternally
by a force 38,000 strong&mdash;about one policeman
for every habitual criminal&mdash;so that, since every policeman
costs £100 a year, and every criminal steals,
eats, or destroys property to the same amount at least,
every criminal costs the country, first, the things
which he steals&mdash;say £100 a year; next, his policeman,
another £100; thirdly, the loss of his own industry;
and fourthly, the loss of the policeman's industry&mdash;making
in all about £500 a year. It would
be cheaper to lock him up.</p>

<p>In the matter of punishments, we have entered
upon a time of greater cruelty than prevailed under
the Plantagenets. Men are boiled, and women are
burned for poisoning; heretics are still burned&mdash;in
1585 one thus suffered for denying the divinity of
Christ; ears are nailed to the pillory and sliced off
for defamation and seditious words; long and cruel
whippings are inflicted&mdash;in one case through Westminster
and London for forgery; an immense number
are hanged every year; the chronicler Macheyn continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">{319}</a></span>
sets down such a fact as that on this day
twelve were hanged at Tyburn, seven men and five
women; mariners were hanged at low water at Wapping,
for offences committed at sea; the good old
custom of pillory was maintained with zeal; and the
parading of backsliders in carts or on horseback was
kept up. Thus, one woman for selling fry of fish, unlawful,
rode triumphantly through the town with garlands
of fish decorating her head and shoulders and
the tail of the horse, while one went before beating a
brass basin. Another woman was carried round, a
distaff in her hand and a blue hood on her head, for
a common scold. A man was similarly honored for
selling measly pork; and another, riding with his head
to the animal's tail, for doing something sinful connected
with lamb and veal.</p>

<p>The cruelty of punishments only shows that the
administration of the law was weak. In fact, the machinery
for enforcing law and repressing crime was
growing more and more unequal to the task, as the
City grew in numbers and in population. The magistrates
sought to deter by the spectacle of suffering.
This is a deterrent which only acts beneficially when
punishment is certain, or nearly certain. The knowledge
that nine criminals will escape for one who is
whipped all the way from Charing Cross to Newgate
encourages the whole ten to continue. Men are like
children: if they are to be kept in the paths of virtue,
it is better to watch and prevent them continually
than to leave them free and to punish them if they
fall. But this great law was not as yet understood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">{320}</a></span></p>

<p>It was on the morning of June 23, in the year of
grace 1603, that I was privileged to behold John
Stow himself in the flesh, and to converse with him,
and to walk with him through the streets of the city
whose history and origin he knew better than any
man of his own age or of any time that has followed
him. It is common enough for a man to live among
posterity, to speak to them and counsel them and
comfort them; but for a man to visit his forefathers
is a thing of rarer occurrence. At another time the
way and manner of slipping backward up the ringing
grooves of change may be explained for the benefit
of others. For the moment, the important thing is
the actual fact.</p>

<p>I found the venerable antiquary in his lodging. He
lived&mdash;it was the year before he died&mdash;with his old
wife, a childless pair, in a house over against the
Church of St. Andrew Undershaft, in the street called
St. Mary Axe. The house itself was modest, containing
two rooms on the ground-floor, and one large
room, or solar, as it would have been called in olden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">{321}</a></span>
time, above. There was a garden at the back, and
behind the garden stood the ruins of St. Helen's Nunnery,
with the grounds and gardens of that once famous
house, which had passed into the possession of
the Leathersellers' Company. This open space afforded
freedom and sweetness for the air, which doubtless
conduced to the antiquary's
length of days.
Outside the door I found,
sitting in an arm-chair,
Mistress Stow, an ancient
dame. She had knitting
in her lap, and she was
fast asleep, the day being
fine and warm, with a
hot sun in the heavens,
and a soft wind from the
south. Without asking her leave, therefore, I passed
within, and mounting a steep, narrow stair, found
myself in the library and in the presence of John
Stow himself. The place was a long room, lofty
in the middle, but with sloping sides. It was lit by
two dormer windows; neither carpet nor arras, nor
hangings of any kind, adorned the room, which was
filled, so that it was difficult to turn about in it, with
books, papers, parchments, and rolls. They lay piled
on the floor; they stood in lines and columns against
the walls; they were heaped upon the table; they lay
at the right hand of the chair ready for use; they
were everywhere. I observed, too, that they were
not such books as may be seen in a great man's library,
bound after the Italian fashion, with costly
leather, gilt letters, golden clasps, and silken strings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">{322}</a></span>
Not so. These books were old folios for the most
part; the backs were broken; the leaves, where any
lay open, were discolored; many of them were in the
Gothic black letter. On the table were paper, pens,
and ink, and in the straight-backed arm-chair sat the
old man himself, pen in hand, laboriously bending
over a huge tome from which he was making extracts.
He wore a black silk cap; his long white hair fell
down upon his shoulders. The casements of the windows
stood wide open, and through one of them,
which looked to the south, the summer sunshine
poured warm and bright upon the old scholar's head,
and upon the table at which he sat.</p>

<p>When I entered the room he looked up, rose, and
bowed courteously. His figure was tall and spare;
his shoulders were rounded by much bending over
books; his face was scored with the lines and wrinkles
of old age; his eyes were clear and keen; but his aspect
was kindly; his speech was soft and gentle.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, "you are welcome. I had never
expected or looked to converse in the flesh, or in
the spirit&mdash;I know not which this visit may be
called&mdash;with one from after generations; from our
children and grandchildren. May I ask to which
generation&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I belong to the late nineteenth century."</p>

<p>"It is nearly three hundred years to come. Bones
o' me! Ten generations! I take this visit, sir, as an
encouragement; even a special mark of favor bestowed
upon me by the Lord, to show His servant that his
work will not be forgotten."</p>

<p>"Forgotten? Nay, Master Stow, there are not
many men of your age whom we would not lose before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">{323}</a></span>
you are forgotten. Believe me, the <i>Survey by
John Stow</i> will last as long as the City itself."</p>

<p>"Truly, sir," the old man replied, "my sole pains
and care have ever been to write the truth. It is forty
years&mdash;&nbsp;Ah, what a man was I at forty! What labors
could I then accomplish between uprising and
downlying! Forty years, I say, since I wrote the
lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of smooth and feathering speech remember to take heed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For truth in plain words may be told; of craft a lie hath need.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Of craft," he repeated, "a lie hath need. If the
world would consider&mdash;well, sir, I am old and my
friends are mostly dead, and men, I find, care little for
the past wherein was life, but still regard the present
and push on towards the future, wherein are death
and the grave. And for my poor services the king
hath granted letters patent whereby I am licensed to
beg. I complain not, though for one who is a London
citizen, and the grandson of reputable citizens, to
beg one's bread is to be bankrupt, and of bankrupts
this city hath great scorn. Yet, I say, I complain
not."</p>

<p>"In so long a life," I said, "you must have many
memories."</p>

<p>"So many, sir, that they fill my mind. Often, as I
sit here, whither cometh no one now to converse
about the things of old, my senses are closed to the
present, and my thoughts carry me back to the old
days. Why"&mdash;his eyes looked back as he spoke&mdash;"I
remember King Harry the Eighth himself, the like of
whom for masterfulness this realm hath never seen.
Who but a strong man could by his own will overthrow&mdash;yea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">{324}</a></span>
and tear up by the very foundations&mdash;the
religion which seemed made to endure forever?
Sure I am that when I was a boy there was no thought
of any change. I remember when in the streets every
second man was priest or monk. The latter still wore
his habit&mdash;grey, white, or black. But you could not
tell the priest from the layman, for the priests were
so proud that they went clothed in silks and furs;
yea, and of bright colors like any court gallant; their
shoes spiked; their hair crisped; their girdles armed
with silver; and in like manner their bridles and their
spurs; their caps laced and buttoned with gold. Now
our clergy go in sober attire, so that the gravity of
their calling is always made manifest to their own and
others' eyes by the mere color of their dress. I remember,
being then a youth, how the Houses were
dissolved and the monks turned out. All were swept
away. There was not even left so much as an hospital
for the sick; even the blind men of Elsing's were
sent adrift, and the lepers from the Lazar house, and
the old priests from the Papey. There was no help
for the poor in those days, and folk murmured, but
below breath, and would fain, but dared not say so,
have seen the old religion again. The king gave the
houses to his friends. Lord Cromwell got Austin
Friars, where my father, citizen and tallow-chandler,
had his house. Nay, so greedy of land was my lord
that he set back my father's wall, and so robbed him
of his garden, and there was no redress, because he
was too strong."</p>

<p>He got up and walked about the room, talking as
he paced the narrow limits. He talked garrulously,
as if it pleased him to talk about the past. "When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">{325}</a></span>
we came presently to study Holy Scripture," he said,
"where there is an example or a warning for everything,
we read the history of Ahab and of Naboth's
vineyard; and for my own part I could never avoid
comparing my Lord Cromwell with Ahab, and the
vineyard with my father's garden, though Naboth had
never to pay rent for the vineyard which was taken
from him as my father had. The end of my Lord
Cromwell was sudden and violent, like the end of
King Ahab."</p>

<p>"You belong to an old city family, Master Stow?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Sir, my forefathers for five generations&mdash;at least,
my memory goes not farther back&mdash;are all buried in
the little green church-yard behind St. Michael's Cornhill.
My grandfather, citizen and tallow-chandler,
died when I was yet of tender years. This have I always
regretted, because he might have told me many
curious things concerning the City in the time of Edward
the Fourth. The penance of Jane Shore he
would surely remember. Nay, he may even have
known that unfortunate lady, wife of a reputable citizen.
Yet have I in my youth conversed with old
men and learned much from them. My grandfather,
by his last will, thought it no superstition to leave
money for watching-candles. I was once taken to the
church to see them burning, and there I remember I
saw a poor woman who received every Sunday, for a
year, one penny for saying five pater-nosters for the
good of his soul. Thus she lived, poor wretch, wasting
her breath in fruitless labor. I marvel to think
what has become of all those who lived by the altar
in the old days. The priests of the churches and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">{326}</a></span>
chantries, the chaplains of the fraternities, the singing-men,
the petty canons, the sextons, singers, sayers of
pater-nosters, sellers of crosses and beads and chaplets
and wax tapers, the monks and the nuns with all their
officers and servants&mdash;there were many thousands in
this city alone&mdash;what became of them? How get
they now a livelihood? Tell me that. As for me, I
have been hauled before the courts on a charge of Papistry.
Bones o' me! All my crime was the reading
of old books, yet do I remember the evil days of King
Edward's time, when the Reformation was new, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">{327}</a></span>
people's minds were troubled, and all things seemed
turning to destruction, so that many welcomed back
the old religion when Mary came, yet when she died
there was found none to mourn for its banishment.
Sir, the old are apt to praise the past, but from one
who has lived through the glorious reign of Queen
Elizabeth shall you hear nothing but praise of the
present. Consider"&mdash;he arose and walked to the open
window and looked out&mdash;"this fine town of London,
like the realm itself, was devoured by the priests and
monks. It is now freed from those locusts. The land
that belonged to the Church could not be sold, so that
those who lived upon it were always tenants and servants.
That land is now free. Learning, which before
was on sufferance, is now free. Nay, there hath
been so great a zeal for learning&mdash;such an exemplar
was Her Highness the Queen&mdash;that noble ladies, as
well as gentlemen, have become skilled in Latin,
Greek, Italian, and even in Hebrew. The trade of
the City hath doubled and trebled. Thanks to the
wisdom of our merchants and their courage, London
doth now surpass Antwerp. The Spaniard, who vainly
thought to rule the world, is humbled, and by us.
The French, who would strike at England through
Scotland, have lost their power. Our ships sail round
the world; our merchants trade with India in the
east and with America in the west: our trading companies
cover all the seas. What does it matter that
I am old and poor and licensed to beg my bread&mdash;and
that in a city which hath ever scorned poverty&mdash;what
does it matter, I say, so that one has lived through
this most happy reign and seen this city increase,
year by year, in wealth and greatness? Who am I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">{328}</a></span>
that I should murmur? I have had my prayer. The
Lord hath graciously made me the historian of the
City. My work will be a monument. What more
can a man want than to have the desire of his heart?"
His voice trembled. He stood in the sunshine, which
wrapped him as with a glory. Then he turned to me.</p>

<p>"Sir," said he, "you are here&mdash;whether in the flesh
or the spirit I know not. Come with me. Let me
show you my city and my people. In three hundred
years there will be many changes and the sweeping
away of many old landmarks, I doubt not. There
must be many changes in customs and usages and in
fashions of manners and of dress. Come with me.
You shall behold my present&mdash;and your past."</p>

<p>He put on his cloak&mdash;a shabby cloak it was, and too
short for his tall figure&mdash;and led the way down the
narrow stairs into the street. He stepped out of the
house, and looked up and down the street, sniffing the
air with the greatest satisfaction, as if it had been laden
with the perfumes of Araby the Blest instead of
the smell of a glue-making shop hard by.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he said, "the air of London is wholesome.
We have had no plague since the sweating sickness,
fifty years ago." (There was to be another the year
after, but this he could not know, and it was not for
me to tell him.) "Yet at Iseldon, hard by, fevers are
again very prevalent, and the falling sickness is reported
from Westminster. This, sir, is the street of
St. Mary Axe. It is not one of our great streets, yet
many worshipful men live here. Opposite is the house
of one who is worth £4000&mdash;aye, £4000 at least; not
a Gresham or a Staple, yet a man of substance." The
house was four stories high, the front of brick and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">{331}</a></span>
timber, the windows filled above and below with rich
carvings, and having a high gable. "The wealth of
private citizens hath lately much increased. In my
youth there were few such houses; now there are a
dozen where formerly there was but one. If you go
into that house, sir, you will find the table plentiful
and the wine good; you will see arras hanging in
every chamber, or a painted cloth with proverbs at
least; sweet herbs or flowers are strewn in every
room; the house is warmed with fires; the sideboards
are loaded with plate or are bright with Murano glass.
There are coffers of ivory and wood to hold the good
man's treasure; and in an upper chamber you shall
see hanging up the cloaks and doublets, the gowns
and petticoats, of this worthy and worshipful merchant
and his family, in silk and velvet, precious and
costly. Fifty years ago there would have been none
of these things, but treen platters; of arras none; and
but one poor silver mazer for all his plate. But we
are not ashamed to see the tenements of the craftsmen
side by side with the great houses of the rich.
For we are all brothers in this city; one family are
we, rich and poor together; we are united in our
companies and in our work; our prentices are taught
their trade; to our maids we give marriage portions;
we suffer no stranger among us; our sick and aged
are kept from want and suffering."</p>

<p>"But you have great Lords and noblemen among
you. Surely they are not of your family."</p>

<p>"Sir, the time was when it was a happy circumstance
for the City to have the nobles within her
walls. That time is past. They are fast leaving our
bounds. One or two alone remain, and we shall not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">{332}</a></span>
lament their departure. There is no longer any danger
that the City will be separate in feeling from the
country, and it is true that the rufflers who follow in
a noble lord's train are ever ready to turn a silly girl's
head or to lead a prentice into dissolute ways. In this
street there were once no fewer than three parish
churches. Yonder ruin at the north end was St. Augustine
on the Wall: here of old times was the house
of the old and sick priests, called the Papey. King
Henry turned them out, and who took in the poor old
men I know not. 'Twas a troubled time. Yonder
was the church&mdash;its church-yard yet remaining&mdash;of
St. Mary Axe, dedicated not only to the Virgin whom
now we have ceased to worship, yet still reverence,
but also to St. Ursula, whom we regard no more, and
to the Eleven Thousand Virgins, at whose pretended
miracle we scoff. And opposite is the goodly church
of St. Andrew Undershaft. Of churches we have
fewer than of old. As for piety, truly I see no difference,
for some will always be pious, and some prodigal
and profligate. I remember," he went on, gazing, as
was his wont, at the church as if he loved the very
stones&mdash;"I remember the May-pole when it hung upon
hooks along the south wall of the church. I never
saw it erected, because Evil May-day, before I was
born, when the prentices rose against the aliens, was
the last time that it was put up. It was destroyed in
King Edward's time, when one Sir Stephen, curate of
Katherine Cree, preached at Paul's Cross that the
May-pole was an idol. So the people brought axes
and cut it up&mdash;the goodliest May-pole that the world
has ever seen, and taller than the steeple of the
church. The same Sir Stephen wanted to change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">{333}</a></span>
the names of the churches, and the names of the week-days,
and the time of Lent, all for the sake of idolatry.
And the same Sir Stephen caused the death of
the most honest man that ever lived, for alleged seditious
words. Well&mdash;'tis fifty years ago."</p>

<p>With this reminiscence we passed through Leadenhall,
and into a broad and open place. "Now," said
Stow, "we are in the very heart of the City. Here
hath been, for time out of mind, a corn-market. And
here are pillory and stocks, but," said Stow, "this pillory
is for false dealing only. The greater pillory is
in Cheapside. Here we have the Tun prison"&mdash;in
shape the building somewhat resembled a tun&mdash;"for
street offenders and the like. It has been a city prison
for three hundred years and more. Beside it is the
conduit. Here are two churches: St. Peter's, which
falsely pretends to be the most ancient of any in the
City, and St. Michael's. But the chief glory of Cornhill
is the Royal Exchange. Let us look in."</p>

<p>The entrance and principal front of the Royal Exchange
were on the south side. We looked in. The
place was crowded with merchants, grave and sober
men, walking within in pairs, or gathered in little
groups. Among them were foreigners from Germany,
France, Venice, Genoa, Antwerp, and even Russia,
conspicuous by their dress. "Before the building of
this place," said Stow, "our merchants had no place
to meet, and were forced to seek out each other; nor
was there any place where the latest news might be
brought, however much the interest of the City might
be affected. Now all is changed, and every morning
our worshipful merchants meet to hear the news, and
to discuss their business. Come, we must not linger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">{334}</a></span>
for we have much to see; else there would be many
things to tell. Believe me, sir, I could discourse all
day long upon the trade of London and yet not make
an end."</p>

<p>He led me past the Royal Exchange, past two
churches, one on the north side and one on the south,
into a broad and open street, which I knew must be
Cheapside.</p>

<p>"Here," said he, "is the beauty of London. This,
good Sir, is Chepe."</p>

<p>The street was at least double the width of its modern
successor. The houses, which were the fairest,
taken all together, in the whole of the City, were
nearly all five stories high, each story projecting above
the one below, with high-pitched gable facing the
street. The fronts were of brick and timber, and
some of them were curiously and richly carved. In
some the third story was provided with a balcony
shaded from the sun. The ground-floor contained the
shop, protected by a prentice. A sign hung in front
of every house. In the middle was Queen Eleanor's
cross, the figure of the Virgin and Holy Infant defaced
by zealous Protestants. Near the cross was the
conduit. The shops on the south side were of grocers,
haberdashers, and upholsterers. Farther west
the goldsmiths stood together, and then the mercers.
The street was filled with people, some riding, some
walking. There were gallants, followed by servants
carrying their swords; there were grave city merchants
and fine city madams; there were working-men
and craftsmen; there were the prentices, too, in every
shop, bawling their wares.</p>

</div>

<p>"When I was a prentice," said Stow, "the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">{337}</a></span>
were made to wear blue cloaks in summer and blue
gowns in winter, with breeches and stockings of white
broadcloth, and flat caps. They attended their master
at night with a lantern and clubs, and they fetched
the water in the morning, unless they were mercers,
who were excused. But all good manners are changed.
Now they dress as they please, and except that they
carry the club and break each other's pates withal,
they are no longer like the old prentice. Also, formerly
£10 would suffice to bind a lad and make him
free of the City; now £100 is wanted. Well, sir, here
you have Chepe. Rich it is with goodly houses and
its ancient churches; I say not stately churches, because
our forefathers loved better to beautify the religious
houses than their parish churches&mdash;yet many
goodly monuments are erected in them to the memories
of dead worthies. Much of the carved work and
the painting has been destroyed or defaced by the zeal
of reformers, who have broken the painted windows
so that false doctrine should no longer be preached
by those dumb orators. Truly, when I think upon the
churches as they were, with all their monuments and
chapels and holy roods, carved and beautified by the
cunning of the sculptor and limner, and look upon
them as they are, hacked and hewn, I am fain to
weep for sorrow. Yet, again, when I remember the
swarms of monks and priests from whom we are set
free, and our holy martyrs who perished in the flames,
I confess that the destruction was needful." He
stepped aside to make room for a gentlewoman who
walked proudly along the street, followed by a servant.</p>

<p>"Aye," he murmured, "thy husband is a respectable
merchant on 'Change; his father before him, citizen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">{338}</a></span>
and armorer, also respected. But his profits will not
long suffice to meet thine extravagance, my fine city
madam."</p>

<p>She was of the middle height, and about thirty
years of age; her hair was a bright red. "A week ago
it was brown," said my guide. It was knotted and
raised above her forehead; on her head she wore a
hood of muslin, under which one could see gold threads
in her hair, and open peascods with pearls for peas;
her face was smeared all over with paint; a heavy
gold chain hung round her neck; her ruff was of enormous
size, and her waist was extravagantly long; her
gown was of rich velvet, looped back to show her petticoat
of flowered satin; she had a lovelock under her
left ear, tied with a freshly-cut rose; she was so stuffed
out with hoops that she covered as much space as six
women; in one hand she carried a fan, and in the
other a pomander-box, at which she sniffed perpetually.</p>

<p>"She moves like a painted galley," said Stow. "No
barge on the river finer to look at. All the argosies
of the East would be swallowed up by such a woman.
'Give, give,' say the daughters of the horse-leech.
Sir, the Lord made the female less comely than her
mate; witness the peahen and the pullet in their russet
garb compared with the splendor of their male.
This, I take it, is the reason why women continually
seek by some new fashion or device to remove the
inequality, and, if possible, to overtop their lords as
well as each other. As for me, I have always loved a
maid in her simplicity, her hair falling in curls about
her lovely face, and her shape visible instead of hidden
under ruffs and hoops. But, alas! what hath a
man of eighty to do with maidens?" he sighed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">{339}</a></span></p>

<p>"Yonder," he went on, "is the chief pillory, the
whipping-place of the City. Chepe is not only a place
of trade and fine clothes. Here have I seen many
things done that would be cruel but for the common
weal. Once I saw a comely maiden lose her ears and
have her forehead branded for trying to poison her
mistress. Once I saw a school-master flogged for
cruelly beating a boy. It was rare to see the boys
shouting and clapping their hands as the poor wretch
screamed. Some have I seen pilloried for cheating,
some for seditious words, some for disorder. Pillory
is a potent physician. The mere sight of these round
holes and that post doth act like a medicine upon old
and young. It is in Smithfield, not in Chepe, that
we chiefly hold our executions. Men and women
have been burned there for other things besides heresy:
for poisoning, for false coining, for murdering.
Many are hanged every year in that ruffians' field.
But to-day we shall not see executions. Let us talk
of more mirthful things. And see, here comes a wedding-train!"</p>

<p>The music came first, a noise of crowds and clarions
playing merrily. Next came damsels bearing bride-cakes
and gilded loaves. After them a young man
carried the silver bride-cup, filled with hippocras and
garnished with rosemary, which stands for constancy.
Then came the bride herself, a very beauteous lady,
dressed all in white, decorated with long chains of
gold, pearls, and precious stones. On her head was a
white lace cap. She was led by two boys in green
and gold. After her walked her parents and other
members of the family.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he said, "there will be rare feasting to-day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">{340}</a></span>
with masks and mumming and dancing. We marry
but once in our lives. 'Twere pity if we could not
once rejoice. Yet there are some who would turn
every feast into a fast, and make even a wedding the
occasion for a sermon. See! after a wedding a funeral.
I am glad the bride met not this. 'Tis bad
luck for a bride to meet a burying."</p>

<p>Then there came slowly marching down the street,
while the people stepped aside and took off their hats,
a funeral procession.</p>

<p>"Who hath died?" asked Stow. "This it is to be
old and to live retired. I have not heard. Yet, considering
the length of the procession, one would say a
prince in Israel. Neighbor," he asked a by-stander,
"whose funeral is this? Ha! So he is dead! A
worthy man; a knight, once sheriff, citizen, and mercer.
You will see, my friend, that we still know how
to mourn our dead worthies, though we lack the singing
clerks and priests who formerly went first, chanting
all the way."</p>

<p>The procession drew nearer. "Now," he said, "I
take it that you will not know the order of the march,
wherefore I will interpret. First, therefore, walk the
children of Christ's Hospital, two by two; he was,
therefore, a benefactor or governor of the school.
Then follow the yeomen conductors, two by two, in
black coats, with black staves. The poor men of the
parish, two by two; then the poor women in like order;
the choir of the church; and the preacher&mdash;he
has crape over his cassock. Then a gentleman in
hood and gown bearing the standard. Next three
gentlewomen in black gowns; there are the aldermen
in violet. Those two grave persons are the executors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">{341}</a></span>
of the deceased. There is the pennon borne by a
gentleman in hood and gown; the helm and crest
borne by a pursuivant; the coat of arms borne by a
herald, Clarence, King at Arms."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 477px;"><a name="OBSEQUIES_OF_SIR_PHILIP_SIDNEY" id="OBSEQUIES_OF_SIR_PHILIP_SIDNEY"></a>
<img src="images/page_341.jpg" width="477" height="334" alt="OBSEQUIES OF SIR PHILIP SIDNEY" title="" />
<span class="caption">OBSEQUIES OF SIR PHILIP SIDNEY</span>
</div>

<p>After this long procession came the coffin itself,
borne by six yeomen in black coats; it was covered
with a black velvet pall. On either side walked two
gentlemen in hoods and gowns, carrying pennons.
One of them bore the arms of the deceased, a gentleman
of good family; one bore the arms of the City;
one those of the Mercer's Company; and one those
of the Merchant Adventurers.</p>

<p>Then came the rest of the procession, and my guide
began again: "There follows the chief mourner, the
eldest son of the deceased; then four other mourners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">{342}</a></span>
two by two; then the Chamberlain and Town Clerk
of the City; the Sword-bearer; the Lord Mayor in
black; the Alderman having no blacks." I confess
that I understood not the distinction, or what followed.
"The estates of women having blacks; Aldermen's
wives having no blacks; the city companies
represented by their wardens and clerks; the masters
of the hospitals having green staves." I could have
asked why they chose this color, but had no time.
"Lastly, the neighbors and parishioners carrying evergreens,
bay, and rosemary."</p>

<p>So it was finished. A procession wellnigh a quarter
of a mile in length.</p>

<p>"Since we must all die," said Master Stow, "it
must be a singular comfort to the rich and those in
high place to think that they will be borne to their
graves in such state and pomp, with, doubtless, a
goodly monument in the church to perpetuate their
memory. As for me, I am poor and of no account,
only a beggar licensed by grace of his Majesty the
King. My parish church hath a fine pall which it
will lend me to cover my coffin. Four men will carry
me across the street and will lower me into my grave.
And so we end."</p>

<p>"Not so an end, good Master Stow," I said. "This
city Knight&mdash;his name I did not catch&mdash;shall be forgotten
before the present generation passes away,
even though they erect a monument to his memory;
but thy achievements will be remembered as long as
London Town shall continue. I see already the monument
that shall be raised to thy memory, in addition
to the book which will never die."</p>

<p>"Amen. So be it," he replied. "Come, you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">{343}</a></span>
seen the merchants in the Royal Exchange, and you
have seen the shops of Chepe. We will now, before
the hour of dinner, visit Paul's Church-yard and Paul's
Walk."</p>

<p>At the western end of Cheapside was the Church
of St. Michael le Quern, a small building sixty feet
long, with a square tower fifty feet high, and a clock
on the south face. At the back of the church was
the little conduit. The houses north and south were
here exactly alike, uniform in size and construction.
On the south side a broad archway, with a single room
above, and a gabled roof, opened into Paul's Church-yard.
"There are six gates," said Stow, "round the
church-yard. This is called Paul's Gate, or, by some,
the Little Gate."</p>

<p>The area included was crowded with buildings and
planted with trees. On the north side were many
shops of stationers, each with its sign&mdash;the White
Greyhound, the Flower de Luce, the Angel, the
Spread Eagle, and others. In the middle rose the
church towering high, its venerable stones black with
age and the smoke of London.</p>

<p>"The place is much despoiled," said the antiquary,
"since the days of the old religion. Many things
have been taken down which formerly beautified the
church-yard. For instance, on this very spot, covered
now with dwelling-houses and shops, was the Charnel
Chapel, as old as King Edward the First. It was a
chapel of the Blessed Virgin. Sir Richard Whittington
endowed it with a chaplain. There were two
brotherhoods; its crypt was filled with bones; the
chapel was filled with monuments. One would have
thought that reverence for the bones would have sufficed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">{344}</a></span>
to preserve the chapel. But no. It was in the
reign of Edward the Sixth, when everything was destroyed.
The Duke of Somerset pulled down the
chapel. The bones he caused to be placed in carts&mdash;they
made a thousand loads&mdash;and to be carried to
Finsbury Fields, where they were thrown out and
strewn around&mdash;a pitiful spectacle. Beside the Charnel
Chapel was the Chapel of the Holy Ghost, served
by the seven chaplains of Holme's College, on the
south side of the church-yard. That, too, was destroyed.
But most of all I lament the destruction of
the Pardon Church-yard. Truly this was one of the
wonders of London. There stands the plot of ground,
a garden now for the minor canons, but formerly a
cloister wherein were buried many persons of worship,
and some of honor, whose monuments were of curious
workmanship. Round the cloister was painted a
dance of death, commonly called the Dance of Paul's,
with verses by John Lydgate, done at the dispense of
John Carpenter. Over the east quadrant was a fair
library, given by Walter Sherrington, chancellor to
Henry the Sixth; and in the cloister was a chapel,
built by the father of Thomas à Becket, who lay
buried there. Of such antiquity was this beautiful
and venerable place. Neither its age nor its beauty
could save it. Nor could the lesson concerning the
presence of death, in this lively portraiture, save it.
Down it must come, and now there remains but two
or three old men like myself who can remember the
Dance of Paul's. Well, the figure of death is gone,
but death himself we cannot drive away. There is
Paul's Cross." He pointed to an edifice at the north-east
angle of the transept.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">{345}</a></span></p>

<p>I looked with curiosity at this historical edifice,
which was smaller, as all historical things are, than
one expected. It was made of timber, mounted upon
steps of stone, and covered with lead. There was
room in it for three or four persons; a low wall was
built round it. A venerable man was preaching to a
small congregation, who sat on wooden benches to
listen.</p>

<p>"What things have not been heard," said Stow, "at
Paul's Cross? Here were the folk motes of old, when
the people were called by the great bell to attend
their parliament, and take counsel together. No
Common Council then, my masters, but every man
his freedom of speech, and his vote. Paul's Cross it
was which made the Reformation. Here have I heard
Latimer, Ridley, Coverdale, Lever, and I know not
whom besides. Here I saw with my own eyes the
Bexley Rood shown, with all the tricks whereby it
was made to open its eyes and lips and seem to speak.
All the Reformation was accomplished from this
Cross. For a king may set up a bishop, and proclaim
a doctrine, but the people's hearts must be moved before
their minds are changed. Think what a change
was made in their minds in a few short years! Masses
for the dead, purgatory, intercession of saints, good
works, submission to the Church, all gone&mdash;all swept
away. And to think that I survive, who was brought
up in the ancient faith, and have witnessed this great
revolution in the minds of men. For now they no
longer even remember their ancient faith, save as the
creed of those who lit the accursed flame of Smithfield,
and still light the flames of Madrid. Let us go
into the church," he said. "But first remember, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">{346}</a></span>
you look round, that in the old days the chapels in
the aisles were always bright with the burning of wax
candles&mdash;a superstition, because the burning of a candle
is a fond thing to save a man's soul withal. Also,
in every chapel, all day long, there was the saying of
masses for the dead&mdash;another fond superstition&mdash;as if
a man's soul is to be saved by the repetition of Latin
prayers by another man. Yet, with these things the
Church fulfilled its purpose. Now there are no more
masses; and the chapels are empty and silent, their
altars are removed, the paintings are defaced, and the
Church is given over for worldly things. Come in."</p>

<p>We entered by the north transept.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 418px;"><a name="DR_SHAW_PREACHING_AT_ST_PAUL39S_CROSS" id="DR_SHAW_PREACHING_AT_ST_PAUL39S_CROSS"></a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">{347}</a></span>

<span class="caption">DR. SHAW PREACHING AT ST. PAUL&#39;S CROSS</span>
</div>

<p>There was much that astonished me in this walk
through London of the year 1603, but nothing so surprising
and unexpected as St. Paul's Cathedral. I had
pictured a church narrow, long, somewhat low and
dark. I found, on the other hand, that it was in every
respect a most noble church, longer than any other
cathedral I had ever seen, loftier, also, and well lighted
in every part, the style grand and simple. Consider,
therefore, my astonishment at finding the church
desecrated and abandoned like the common streets
for the general uses of the people. The choir alone,
where the old screen still stood, was reserved for purposes
of worship, for there was a public thoroughfare
through the transepts and across the church. Men
tramped through, carrying baskets of meat or of bread,
sacks of coal, bundles, bags, and parcels of all kinds,
walking as in the streets, turning neither to right nor
left. Hucksters and peddlers not only walked through,
but lingered on their way to sell their wares. Servants
stood and sat about a certain pillar to be hired;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">{349}</a></span>
scriveners sat about another pillar writing letters for
those who required their services; clergymen in quest
of a curacy or vicarage gathered at another pillar.
"Remember the verses," said Stow:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Who wants a churchman that can service say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Read first and faire his monthlie homilie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wed and bury and make Christian soules?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come to the left side alley of St. Paul's.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The poor clergymen," he went on, "have fallen
upon evil times; there is not preferment enough for
all of them, and many of the country parishes are too
poor to keep a man, even though he live more hardly
than a yeoman.</p>

<p>"This," he added, "is an exchange where almost as
much business is done as at Sir Thomas Gresham's
Burse, but of another kind. Here are houses bought
and sold; here is money lent on usury; here are conspiracies
hatched, villanies resolved upon; here is the
honor of women bought and sold; here, if a man
wants a handful of desperadoes for the Spanish Main,
he may buy them cheap&mdash;look at those men standing
by the tomb that they call Duke Humphrey's."</p>

<p>They were three tall, lean fellows, each with a long
rapier and a worn doublet and a hungry face. Only
to look upon them made one think of John Oxenham
and his companions.</p>

<p>"These men should be taking of Panama or Guayaquil,"
said Stow. "The time grows too peaceful for
such as those. But see, this is Paul's Walk; this is
the Mediterranean."</p>

<p>The long middle aisle was crowded with a throng
of men walking to and fro, some alone, some two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">{350}</a></span>
three together. Some of them were merchants or
retailers, some were countrymen looking about them
and crying out for the loftiness of the roof and grandeur
of the church. But many were young gallants,
and those were evidently come to show the splendor
of their dress and to mark and follow the newest fashions,
which, like women, they learned from each other.</p>

<p>"These lads," said Stow, again echoing my thoughts,
"were also better on board a stout ship bound for the
West Indies than at home spending their fortunes
on their backs, and their time in pranking before the
other gallants. Yet they are young. Folly sits well on
the young. In youth we love a brave show, if only
to please the maidens. Let us not, like the sour
preacher, cry out upon a young man because he glorifies
his body by fine raiment. To such a jagg'd and
embroidered sleeve is as bad as the sound of pipe and
tabor or the sight of a playhouse. Let them preach.
For all their preaching our gallants will still be fine.
It is so long since I was young that I have well-nigh
forgotten the feeling of youth. It is now their time.
For them the fine fashions; for them the feasting;
for them the love-making; for us to look on and to
remember. At the mutability of the fashion we may
laugh, for there is no sense in it, but only folly. To-day
the high Alman fashion; to-morrow the Spanish
guise; the day after, the French. See with what an
air they walk; head thrown back, hand on hip, leg
advanced. Saw one ever gallants braver or more
splendid? No two alike, but each arrayed in his own
fashion as seemeth him best, though each would have
the highest ruff and the longest rapier. And look at
their heads&mdash;as many fashions with their hair as with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">{351}</a></span>
their cloak and doublet. One is polled short; one
has curls; another, long locks down to his shoulders.
And some shave their chins; some have long beards,
and some short beards. Some wear ear-rings, and
have love-locks. Why not, good sir? Bones a' me!
Plenty of time to save and hoard when we grow old.
The world and the play of the world belong to the
young. Let them enjoy the good things while they
can."</p>

<p>While we were talking in this manner the clock
struck the hour of eleven. Instantly there was a general
movement towards the doors, and before the last
stroke had finished ringing and echoing in the roof
the church was empty, save for a few who still lingered
and looked at each other disconsolately.</p>

<p>"It is the dinner-hour," said Stow.</p>

<p>"Then," said I, "lead me to some tavern where we
may dine at our ease."</p>

<p>"There are many such taverns close to Paul's," he
replied. "The Three Tuns in Newgate, the Boar's
Head by London Stone, the Ship at the Exchange,
the Mermaid in Cornhill, or the Mitre of Chepe. But
of late my dinners have been small things, and I know
not, what any town gallant could tell you, where to
go for the best burnt sack or for sound Rhenish."</p>

<p>"The Mitre, then, on the chance."</p>

<p>This tavern, a gabled house, stood at the end of a
passage leading from Cheapside, near the corner of
Bread Street. The long room spread for dinner was
two steps lower than the street, and not too well
lighted. A narrow table ran down the middle; upon
it was spread a fair white cloth; a clean napkin lay
for every guest, and a knife. The table was already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">{352}</a></span>
filled. Loaves of bread were placed at intervals;
they were of various shapes, round and square; salt
was also placed at regular intervals. When we entered,
the company stood up politely till we had found
seats. Then all sat down again.</p>

<p>We took our seats in a corner, whence we could
observe the company. Stow whispered in my ear
that this was a shilling ordinary, and one of the best
in London, as was proved by the number of guests.
"Your city gallant," he said, "scents his dinner like a
hound, and is never at fault. We shall dine well."</p>

<p>We did dine well; the boys brought us first roast
beef with peas and buttered beans. "This," said the
old man, "is well&mdash;everything in season. At midsummer,
beef and beans; at Michaelmas, fresh herrings;
at All Saints, pork and souse, sprats and spurlings;
in Lent, parsnips and leeks, to soften the
saltness of the fish; at Easter, veal and bacon, or at
least gammon of bacon, and tansy cake with stained
eggs; at Martinmas, salt beef. Let old customs be
still maintained. Methinks we are back in the days
of bluff King Hal. Well, London was ever a city of
plenty. Even the craftsman sits down to his brown-bread
and bacon and his ale. Harry, bring me a tankard
of March beer&mdash;and another dish of beef, tell the
carver."</p>

</div>

<p>After the beef, we were served with roast capons
and ducks. The absence of forks was partly made up
by the use of bread, and no one scrupled to take the
bones and suck them or even crunch them. But there
was so much politeness and so many compliments
passing from one to the other, that those small points
passed almost unnoticed, even by my unaccustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">{355}</a></span>
eyes. One quickly learns to think more of the people
than of their ways in little things. Apart from their
bravery in dress and their habit of compliment, I was
struck with the cheerfulness and confidence, even the
extravagance, of their talk. Their manner was that of
the soldier, sanguine, confident, and rather loud. Some
there were who looked ready to ruffle and to swagger.</p>

<p>The capon was followed by a course of cakes and
fruit. Especially, the confection known as march-pane,
in which the explorer lights upon filberts, almonds,
and pistachio nuts, buried in sugared cake, hath
left a pleasing memory in my mind.</p>

<p>Dinner over, the old man, my guide, offered no opposition
to a flask of wine, which was brought in a
glass measure with sugar thrown in.</p>

<p>"For choice," he said, "give me malmsey full and
fine, sweetened with sugar. Your French wines are
too thin for my old blood. Boy, bring a clean pipe
and tobacco."</p>

<p>By this time almost every man in the room was
smoking, though some contented themselves with
their snuff-boxes. The tables were cleared, the boys
ran about setting before every man his cup of wine
and taking the reckoning.</p>

<p>Tobacco, the old man said, though introduced so
recently, had already spread over the whole country,
so that most men and many women took their pipe
of tobacco every day with as much regularity as their
cup of wine or tankard of ale. So widespread was
now the practice that many hundreds made a livelihood
in London alone by the retailing of this herb.</p>

<p>"And now," he said, when his pipe was reduced to
ashes, "let us across the river and see the play at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">{356}</a></span>
Globe. The time serves; we shall be in the house
before the second flourish."</p>

<p>There was a theatre, he told me on the way, easier
of access among the ruins of the Dominicans', or
Black Friars', Abbey, but that was closed for the moment.
"We shall learn," he added, "the piece that is
to be played from the posts of Queenhithe, where we
take oars." In fact, we found the posts at that port
placarded with small bills, announcing the performance
of "Troilus and Cressida."</p>

<p>Bank Side consisted, I found, of a single row of
houses, built on a dike, or levee, higher both than
the river at high tide and the ground behind the
bank. Before the building of the bank this must
have been a swamp covered with water at every tide;
it was now laid out in fields, meadows, and gardens.
At one end of Bank Side stood the Clink Prison,
Winchester House, and St. Mary Overies Church.
At the other end was the Falcon Tavern, with its
stairs, and behind it was the Paris Gardens.</p>

<p>The fields were planted with many noble trees, and
in every one there was a pond or stagnant ditch which
showed the nature of the ground. A little to the
west of the Clink and behind the houses stood the
Globe Theatre, and close beside it the "Bull-baiting."
The theatre, erected in the year 1593, was hexagonal
externally. It was open in the middle, but the stage
and the galleries within were covered over with a
thatched roof. Over the door was the sign of the
house&mdash;Hercules supporting the globe, with the legend,
"<i>Totus mundus agit histrionem.</i>"</p>

<img src="images/page_357.jpg" width="389" height="174" alt="GLOBE THEATRE" title="" />
<span class="caption">GLOBE THEATRE</span>
</div>

<p>The interior of the theatre was circular in shape.
It contained three galleries, one above the other; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">{357}</a></span>
lowest called the "rooms," for seats in which we paid
a shilling each, contained the better sorts. At each
side of the stage there were boxes, one of which contained
the music. The stage itself, a stout construction
of timber, projected far into the pit, or, as Stow
called it, the "yarde." At the back was another
stage, supported on two columns, and giving the
players a gallery about ten or twelve feet high, the
purpose of which we were very soon to find out. On
each side of the stage were seats for those who paid
an additional sixpence. Here were a dozen or twenty
gallants, either with pipes of tobacco, or playing cards
or dice before the play began. One of them would
get up quickly with a pretence of impatience, and
push back his cloak so as to show the richness of his
doublet below. The young men, whether at the theatre,
or in Paul's Walk, or in Chepe, seemed all intent
upon showing their bravery of attire; no girls of our
day could be more vain of their dress, or more critical
of the dress worn by others. Some of them, however,
I perceived among the groundlings&mdash;that is, the people
in the "yarde"&mdash;gazing about the house upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">{358}</a></span>
the women in the galleries. Here there were many
dressed very finely, like ladies of quality, in satin
gowns, lawn aprons, taffeta petticoats, and gold threads
in their hair. They seemed to rejoice in being thus
observed and gazed upon. When a young man had
found a girl to his taste, he went into the gallery, sat
beside her, and treated her to pippins, nuts, or wine.</p>

<p>It was already one o'clock when we arrived. As we
took our seats the music played its first sounding or
flourish. There was a great hubbub in the place:
hucksters went about with baskets crying pippins,
nuts, and ale; in the "rooms" book-sellers' boys hawked
about new books; everybody was talking together;
everywhere the people were smoking tobacco, playing
cards, throwing dice, cheapening books, cracking nuts,
and calling for ale. The music played a second sounding.
The hubbub continued unabated. Then it played
the third and last. Suddenly the tumult ceased. The
piece was about to begin.</p>

<p>The stage was decorated with blue hangings of silk
between the columns, showing that the piece was to
be&mdash;in part, at least&mdash;a comedy. Across the raised
gallery at the back was stretched a painted canvas
representing a royal palace. When the scene was
changed this canvas became the wall of a city, and the
actors would walk on the top of the wall; or a street
with houses; or a tavern with its red lattice and its
sign; or a tented field. When night was intended,
the blue hangings were drawn up and exchanged for
black.</p>

<p>The hawkers retired and were quiet; the house settled
down to listen, and the Prologue began. Prologue
appeared dressed in a long black velvet cloak; he assumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">{359}</a></span>
a diffident and most respectful manner; he
bowed to the ground.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In Troy there lies the scene. From isles of Greece,<br /></span>

<span class="caption">INSIDE OF THE RED BULL PLAYHOUSE</span>
</div>

<p>In this way the mind of the audience was prepared
for what was to follow. We needed no play-bill. The
palace before us could be no other than Priam's Palace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">{360}</a></span>
If there was a field with tents, it must be the battle-field
and the camp of the Greeks; if there was a wall,
it must be the wall of Troy. And though the scenery
was rough, it was enough. One wants no more than
the unmistakable suggestion; the poet and the actor
find the rest. Therefore, though the intrusive gallants
lay on the stage; though Troilus was dressed in the
armor of Tudor-time, and Pandarus wore just such a
doublet as old Stow himself, we were actually at Troy.
The boy who played Cressida was a lovely maiden.
The narrow stage was large enough for the Council of
Kings, the wooing of lovers, and the battle-field of
heroes. Women unfaithful and perjured, lovers trustful,
warriors fierce, the alarms of war, fighting and
slaying, the sweet whispers of love drowned by the
blare of trumpets; the loss of lover forgotten in the
loss of a great captain; and among the warriors and
the kings and the lovers, the creeping creatures who
live upon the weaknesses and the sins of their betters,
played their parts upon these narrow boards before a
silent and enraptured house. For three hours we
were kept out of our senses. There was no need, I
say, of better scenery; a quick shifting of the canvas
showed a battle-field and turned the stage into a vast
plain covered with armies of Greeks and Romans.
Soldiers innumerable, as thick as motes in the sun,
crossed the stage fighting, shouting, challenging each
other. While they fought, the trumpets blew and the
drums beat, the wounded fell, and the fight continued
over these prostrate bodies till they were carried off
by their friends. The chiefs rushed to the front, crossed
swords, and rushed off again. "Come, both you cogging
Greeks!" said Troilus, while our cheeks flushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">{361}</a></span>
and our lips parted. If the stage had been four times
as broad, if the number of men in action had been
multiplied by ten, we could not have felt more vividly
the rage, the joy, the madness of the battle.</p>

<p>When the play was finished, the ale, the apples, and
the nuts were passed round, and the noise began again.
Then the clown came in and began to sing, and the
music played&mdash;but oh, how poor it seemed after the
great emotions of the play! The old man plucked me
by the sleeve, and we went out, and with us most of
the better sort.</p>

<p>"The first plays," said the antiquary, "that ever I
saw were those that were played on stages put up in
the court-yards of inns, where the galleries afforded
place for the audience, and the stage was made of
boards laid upon trestles. Tarleton used to play at
the Bull Inn, Bishopsgate, and at the Cross Keys,
Grasse Street. He was reckoned a famous player, yet,
compared with those we have seen this day, a fustian
mouther, no doubt. Rude plays they were, and rude
players; but I dare say they moved the spectators as
much as this fine theatre."</p>

<p>Not far from the Globe stood another building of
circular form; a throng of people pressed about the
doors, and a great noise of barking and shouting came
from within. "It is the Bull-baiting," said my guide.
"But the place is full of rough men, whose wrath is
easily moved, and then out come knives and there is
a tumult. I am too old for such things. Nevertheless,
it is a noble sport; and when you come to whipping
the blinded bear, who lately broke away and bit
a piece out of a man's thigh, it passes all." He lingered
as if he would join in it once more with a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">{362}</a></span>
encouragement. Finding none, he walked slowly away
to the river-bank.</p>

<p>"This place," said Stow, "hath an ill name, by reason
of evil-doers, who were long permitted to live here&mdash;a
place notorious for three hundred years as the
common sink of the city. No reputable citizen would
have his country-house and garden on Bank Side.
Why, there are private gardens all round London as
far north as Islington, and as far east as Ratcliffe Cross,
but none here. The air is fresh and wholesome coming
up the river, the ground fertile: see the trees and
hedges how they flourish; yet there is never a private
garden in the place. For this reason the bull-baiting
was here, and Paris Gardens with its bears&mdash;an' it were
Sunday, I would show you the bears&mdash;old Harry
Hunks and Sackerson. For this reason was the Globe
built here, without the city precincts. Where are the
theatres and the baitings, the musicians and the shows,
thither must gather together the poets, singers, mummers,
and all those who live by ministering to the
merriment and pleasure of the world. A company
of keen wits they are, their tongues readier than most,
and their talk bolder. Sober merchants, who think
more of the matter and less of the manner, like not
such company." Here the tinkling of a guitar, followed
by a burst of laughter, interrupted the discourse.
"I doubt not," said Stow, "that we have here&mdash;'tis the
Falcon Tavern&mdash;a company of wits and poets and
players. Let us tarry but the drinking of a single
flask. It may be, unless their tongues are more free
than is seemly, that we shall be rewarded."</p>

<p>The Falcon Inn stood at the western end of Bank
Side, at the head of the Falcon stairs. In front a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">{363}</a></span>
small garden stretched out
towards the river.
Part of the garden was
an arbor, formed by a
vine raised on poles,
so as to form a roof
of leaves. Here was
a table placed, and
round the table a
company of ten
or a dozen.
At the head of
the table was a young gentleman
richly dressed. Behind
him stood two servants.
At his right sat a man of
about thirty, of large frame
and already corpulent, his
brown hair short and
curly, his beard cut
short, his eyes singularly
bright.</p>

<span class="caption">SOUTH VIEW OF FALCON TAVERN, ON THE

</div>

<p>"'Tis Ben Jonson,"
whispered Stow. "Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">{364}</a></span>
us sit here, without the arbor, so that we can drink and
listen. Ben is but lately out of prison, where he was
cast for writing reflections on the Scottish nation.
'Twas said that he would lose his ears and have his
nose slit, but the King showed mercy. He at the
head of the table is some young nobleman, patron of
poets, but, alas! I live now so retired that I know
not his name. On the left of him is William Shakespeare,
whom some think a better poet than Ben&mdash;a
quiet man who says little. I have seen him here before.
'Twas he wrote the piece we have seen this day.
He has a share in the theatre of Blackfriars. Burbage,
the actor, sits next to Shakespeare, and then Alleyn
and Hemying opposite, and Henslowe. And there is
John Marston, another poet."</p>

<p>Alleyn it was who held the guitar. At this time he
was in the prime of life, not yet forty, his face full of
mobility and quickness. He ran his fingers carelessly
over the notes, and then began to sing in a clear, high
voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>"Sir," said the young gentleman, "'tis an excellent
song well sung. I drink your health."</p>

<p>This he did rising, and very courteously.</p>

<p>Now, in the talk that followed I observed that,
while the players amused by relating anecdotes, Ben
Jonson made laughter by what he said, speaking in
language which belongs to scholars and to books, and
that Shakespeare sat for the most part in silence, yet
not in the silence of a blockhead in the presence of
wits, and when he spoke it was to the purpose. Also
I remarked that the guitar passed from hand to hand,
and that everybody could play and sing, and that the
boldness of the talk showed the freedom of their
minds. Who can repeat the unrestrained conversation
of a tavern company? Nay, since some of them
were more than merry with the wine, it would be an
ill turn to set down what they said. We drank our
cups and listened to the talk.</p>

<p>Presently Ben Jonson himself sang one of his own
songs, in a rough but not unmelodious voice:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">{366}</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Follow a shadow, it still flies you;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Say, are not women truly, then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Styled but the shadows of the men?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We came away about sunset, or near half-past eight
in the evening. Some of the company were by this
time merry with their wine, and as we rose one began
to bawl an old tavern ditty, drumming on the wood
of the guitar with his knuckles:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There was a Ewe had three lambs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one of them was blacke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was a man had three sons&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jeffrey, James, and Jack.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The one was hanged, the other drown'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The third was lost and never found;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man he fell in a sound&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come fill us a cup of Sacke."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was nearly high tide on the river, which spread
itself out full and broad between the banks, reflecting
the evening glow in the western sky. Numberless
swans floated about the stream. It was also covered
with boats. Some were state barges belonging to
great people, with awnings and curtains, painted and
gilt, filled with ladies who sang as the boat floated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">{367}</a></span>
quietly with the current to the music of guitars.
Others were the cockle-shell of humble folk. Here
was the prentice, taking his sweetheart out upon the
river for the freshness of the evening air; here the
citizen, with his wife and children in a wherry; here
the tilt-boat, with its load of passengers coming up
from Greenwich to Westminster. There were also
the barges and lighters laden with hay, wool, and
grain, waiting for the tide to turn in order to unload
at Queenhithe or Billingsgate.</p>

<p>"This," said Stow, "is the best place of any for a
prospect of the city. Here we can count the spires
and the towers. I know them every one. Look how
Paul's rises above the houses. His walls are a hundred
feet high. His tower that you see is near three
hundred feet high, and his spire, which has been
burned down these forty years, was two hundred feet
more. Alas, that goodly spire! It is only from this
bank that you can see the great houses along the
river. There the ruins of White Friars&mdash;there those
of the Dominicans. Ruins were they not, but splendid
buildings in the days of my youth. Baynard's Castle,
the Steel Yard, Cold Harbor, the Bridge&mdash;there they
stand. The famous city of Venice itself, I dare swear,
cannot show so fair a prospect. See, now the sun
lights up the windows of Nonesuch on the Bridge&mdash;see
how the noble structure is reflected in the water
below. Good sir," he turned to me with glowing face
and eyes aflame with enthusiasm, "there is no other
city in the whole world, believe me, which may compare
with this noble City of London, of which&mdash;glory
to God!&mdash;I have been permitted to become the humble
historian."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">{368}</a></span></p>

<p>We took boat at Falcon stairs&mdash;Stow told me there
were two thousand boats and three thousand watermen
on the river&mdash;and we returned to Queenhithe,
the watermen shouting jokes and throwing strong
words at each other, which seems to be their custom.
By the time we landed the sun had gone down.
Work for the day was over, and the streets were
thronged with people. First, however, it was necessary
to think of supper. My guide took me to an old
inn in Dowgate; you entered it as at the Mitre by a
long passage. This was the well-known Swan, where
we found a goodly company assembled. They seemed
to be merchants all; grave men, not given to idle
mirth, so that the conversation was more dull (if more
seemly) than at the Falcon. For supper they served
us roast pullet with a salad of lettuce, very good, and
a flask of right Canary. My ancient guide swore&mdash;"Bones
a' me"&mdash;that it contained the very spirit and
essence of the Canary grape. "Sir," he said, "can a
man live in London for eighty years and fail to discern
good wine from bad? Why, the city drinks up, I
believe, all the good wine in the world. Amsterdam
is built on piles set in the ooze and mud. London
floats on puncheons, pipes, and hogsheads of the best
and choicest. This is truly rare Canary. Alas! I am
past eighty. I shall drink but little more."</p>

<p>So he drank and warmed his old heart and discussed
further, but it would be idle to set down all he
said, because most of it is in books, and my desire has
been to record only what cannot be found, by the curious,
already printed.</p>

<p>After supper we had more wine and tobacco. Some
of the company fell to card-playing, some to dice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">{369}</a></span>
Then the door opened, and a man came in with two
children, boys, who sang with him while he played the
guitar. They sang madrigals very sweetly, each his
own part truly and with justice. When they finished,
the boys went around with a platter and collected
farthings. And having paid our reckoning we went
away.</p>

<p>In the streets outside, the women sat at their doors
or stood about gossiping with each other. At every
corner a bonfire was merrily burning. This was partly
because it was the Vigil of St. John the Baptist,
partly because in the city they always lit bonfires in
the summer months to purify and cleanse the air.
But because of the day every door was shadowed with
green branches&mdash;birch, long fennel, St. John's wort,
orpin, white lilies, and such like&mdash;garnished with garlands
of beautiful flowers. They had also hung up
lamps of colored glass, with oil to burn all the night,
so that the streets looked gay and bright with the red
light of the bonfires playing on the tall gabled fronts,
and the red and green light of the lamps. From all
the taverns, as we passed, came the sound of music,
singing, and revelry, with the clink of glasses and the
uplifting of voices thick with wine. There was the
sound of music and singing from the private houses.
Everywhere singing&mdash;everywhere joy and happiness.
In the streets the very prentices and their sweethearts
danced, to the pipe and tabor, those figures called
the Brawl and the Canary, and better dancing, with
greater spirit and more fidelity to the steps, had I
never before seen.</p>

<p>At last we stopped once more before the door of
John Stow's house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">{370}</a></span></p>

<p>"Sir," he said, taking my hand, "the time has come
to bid you farewell. It has been a great honor&mdash;believe
me&mdash;to converse with one of a generation yet to
come, and a great satisfaction to learn that my name
will live so long beside those of the poets of this noble
age. Many things there are into which I would fain
have inquired. The looking into futurity is an idle
thing, yet I would fain have asked if you have put a
new steeple on Paul's; if you still suffer the desecration
of that place; if London will spread still more
beyond her walls; if her trade will still more increase;
if the Spaniard will be always permitted to hold the
Continent of America; if the Pope will still be reigning;
with many other things. But you came this day
to learn, and I to teach. When next you come, suffer
me in turn to put questions. And now, good sir, farewell.
Behold!" He raised his hands in admiration.
"I have spent a day&mdash;a whole day&mdash;with a man of the
nineteenth century!! Bones a' me!!!"</p>

<p>So he went within and shut the door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">{371}</a></span></p>



<hr style='margin-left:17.5%; width:65%'/>
<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">CHARLES THE SECOND</span></h2>


<p>It is not proposed here to swell with any new
groans the general chorus of lamentation over
the deplorable morals of King Charles's court. Let
us acknowledge that we want all the available groans
for the deplorable morals of our own time. Let us
leave severely on one side Whitehall, with the indolent
king: his mistresses, his singing boys, his gaming tables,
his tinkling guitars, his feasting and his dancing.
We will have nothing whatever to do with
Chiffinch and his friends, nor with Rochester, nor
with Nell Gwynne, nor with Old Rowley himself.
Therefore, of course, we can have nothing to do with
Messrs. Wycherley, Congreve, and company. It is, I
know, the accepted excuse for these dramatists that
their characters are not men and women, but puppets.
To my humble thinking they are not puppets at all,
but living and actual human creatures&mdash;portraits of
real men and women who haunted Whitehall. Let
us keep to the east of Temple Bar: hither come
whispers, murmurs, rumors, of sad doings at court:
sober and grim citizens, still touched with the Puritan
spirit, speak of these rumors with sorrow and disappointment;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">{372}</a></span>
they had hoped better things after the
ten years' exile, yet they knew so little and were always
ready to believe so well of the King&mdash;and his
Majesty was always so friendly to the City&mdash;that the
reports remained mere reports. It is really no use to
keep a king unless you are able to persuade yourself
that he is wiser, nobler, more virtuous, braver, and
greater than ordinary mortals. Indeed, as the head
and leader of the nation, he is officially the wisest,
noblest, bravest, best, and greatest among us, and is
so recognized in the Prayer-book. Even those who
are about the court, and therefore are so unhappy as
to be convinced of the exact contrary, do their best
to keep up the illusion. The great mass of mankind
still continue to believe that moral and intellectual
superiority goes with the crown and belongs to the
reigning sovereign. The only change that has come
over nations living under the monarchic form of government
as regards their view of kings is that they
no longer believe all this of the reigning sovereign's
predecessor; as regards the present occupant of the
throne, of course. Are the citizens of a republic similarly
convinced as regards their President?</p>

<p>The evil example of the court, therefore, produced
very little effect upon the morals of the City. At
first, indeed, the whole nation, tired to death of grave
faces, sober clothes, Puritanic austerity, godly talk,
downcast eyes, and the intolerable nuisance of talking
and thinking perpetually about the very slender
chance of getting into heaven, rushed into a reckless
extreme of brave and even gaudy attire and generous
feasting, the twang of the guitar no longer prohibited,
nor the singing of love ditties, nor the dancing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">{375}</a></span>
youths and maids forbidden. Even this natural reaction
affected only the young. The heart of the City
was, and remained for a hundred and fifty years afterwards,
deeply affected with the Puritanic spirit. It
has been of late years the fashion of the day&mdash;led by
those who wish to saddle us again with sacerdotalism&mdash;to
scoff and laugh at this spirit. It has nearly disappeared
now, even in America; but we may see in it
far more than what has been called the selfish desire
of each man to save his own soul. We may see in it,
especially, the spirit of personal responsibility, the loss
of which&mdash;if we ever do lose it, should authority be
able to reassert her old power&mdash;will be fatal to intellectual
or moral advance. Personal responsibility
brings with it personal dignity, enterprise, courage,
patience, all the virtues. Only that man who stands
face to face with his Maker, with no authority intervening,
can be called free. But when the young men
of the City had had their fling, in the first rush and
whirlpool of the Restoration, they settled down
soberly to business again. The foundation of the
Hudson's Bay Company proves that the Elizabethan
spirit of enterprise was by no means dead. The Institution
of the Royal Society, which had its first home
in Gresham College, proves that the City thought of
other useful things besides money-getting. The last
forty years of the seventeenth century, however, might
have been passed over as presenting no special points
of change, except in the gradual introduction of tea
and coffee. As London was in the time of Elizabeth,
so it was, with a few changes, in the time of Charles
the Second. A little variation in the costumes; a
little alteration in the hour of dinner; a greatly extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">{376}</a></span>
trade over a much wider world; and, in all
other respects, the same city.</p>

<p>Two events&mdash;two disasters&mdash;give special importance
to this period. I mean the Plague and the
Fire.</p>

<p>The Plague was the twelfth of its kind which visited
the City during a period of seven hundred years.
The twelfth and the last. Yet not the worst. That
of the year 1407 is said to have killed half the population:
that of 1517, if historians are to be believed in
the matter of numbers, which is seldom the case, killed
more than half. Of all these plagues we hear no more
than the bare, dreadful fact, "Plague&mdash;so many thousands
killed." That is all that the chronicles tell us.
Since there was no contemporary historian we know
nothing more. How many plagues have fallen upon
poor humanity, with countless tragedies and appalling
miseries, but with no historian? We know all about
the Plague of Athens, the Plague of Florence, the
Plague of London&mdash;the words require no dates&mdash;but
what of the many other plagues?</p>

<p>The plague was no new thing; it was always threatening;
it broke out on board ship; it was carried
about in bales; it was brought from the Levant with
the figs and the spices; some sailor was stricken with
it; reports were constantly flying about concerning it;
now it was at Constantinople; now at Amsterdam;
now at Marseilles; now at Algiers; everybody knew
that it might come again at any time. But it delayed;
the years went on; there was no plague; the younger
people ceased to dread it. Then, like the Deluge,
which may stand as the type of disaster long promised
and foretold, and not to be avoided, yet long delayed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">{377}</a></span>
it came at last. And when it went away it had destroyed
near upon a hundred thousand people.</p>

<p>We read the marvellous history of the Plague as it
presented itself to the imagination of Daniel Defoe,
who wrote fifty years after the event. Nothing ever
written in the English language holds the reader with
such a grip as his account of the Plague. It seems as
if no one at the time could have been able to speak or
think of anything but the Plague; we see the horror
of the empty streets; we hear the cries and lamentations
of those who are seized and those who are bereaved.
The cart comes slowly along the streets with
the man ringing a bell and crying, "Bring out your
dead! Bring out your dead!" We think of the great
<i>fosses communes</i>, the holes into which the dead were
thrown in heaps and covered with a little earth; we
think of the grass growing in the streets; the churches
deserted; the clergymen basely flying; their places
taken by the ejected nonconformists who preach of
repentance and forgiveness&mdash;no time, this, for the Calvinist
to number the Elect on his ten fingers&mdash;to as
many as dare assemble together; the roads black with
fugitives hurrying from the abode of Death; we hear
the frantic mirth of revellers snatching to-night a
doubtful rapture, for to-morrow they die. The City is
filled with despair. We look into the pale faces of
those who venture forth; we hear the sighs of those
who meet; nobody&mdash;nobody, we imagine&mdash;can think
of aught else than the immediate prospect of death
for himself and all he loves.</p>

<p>Pepys, however, who remained in the City most of
the time, not only notes down calmly the progress of
the pestilence, but also allows us to see the effect it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">{378}</a></span>
produced on his own mind. It is very curious. He
reads the Bills of Mortality as they are published: he,
as well as Defoe, records the silent and deserted appearance
of the town: he confesses, now and then,
that he is fearful; but his mind is all the time
entirely occupied with his own advancement and his
own pleasures. He feasts and drinks with his friends;
he notes that "we were very merry." Occasionally
he betrays a little anxiety, but he is never panic-stricken.</p>

<p>In the entry of September, when the Plague was at
its height, and the terror and misery of London at
their worst, he writes: "To the Tower, and there sent
for the weekly Bill, and find 8252 dead in all, and of
these 6978 of the Plague, which is a most dreadful
number and shows reason to fear that the Plague hath
got that hold that it will yet continue among us.
Thence to Branford, reading 'The Villaine,' a pretty
good play, all the way. There a coach of Mr. Povy's
stood ready for me, and he at his house ready to come
in, and so we together merrily to Swakely to Sir R.
Viner." And the same week, hearing that Lord Sandwich
with the fleet had taken some prizes&mdash;"the receipt
of this news did put us all into an extasy of joy
that it inspired into Sir J. Minner and Mr. Evelyn
such a spirit of mirth, that in all my life I never met
with so merry a two hours as our company this night
was." Perhaps, however, this excess of mirth was not
due to insensibility, but was a natural reaction from
the gloom and terror that stalked the streets.</p>

<p>The summer of 1665 was curiously hot and dry.
Every day a blue sky, a scorching sun, and no breath
of wind. If bonfires were kindled to purify the air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">{379}</a></span>
the smoke ascended and hung overhead in a motionless
cloud. From May till September, no wind, no
rain, no cloud, only perpetual sunshine to mock the
misery of the prostrate city.</p>

<p>At the first outbreak of the disease the people began
to run away; the roads were black with carts
carrying their necessaries into the country; the City
clergy for the most part deserted their churches;
physicians ran from the disease they could not cure,
pretending that they had to go away with their patients;
the Court left Whitehall; the Courts of Justice
were removed to Oxford. The Archbishop of Canterbury,
however, remained at Lambeth Palace, and the
Duke of Albemarle and Lord Craven remained in their
town houses. And the Lord Mayor, Sir John Laurence,
ordered that the aldermen, sheriffs, common
councilmen, and all constables and officers of the City
should remain at their posts.</p>

<p>As the Plague increased, business of all kinds was
suspended; works were closed; ships that arrived
laden, went down the river again and across to Amsterdam;
ships that waited for their cargoes lay idle in the
Pool by hundreds; shops were shut; manufactories
and industries of all kinds were stopped.</p>

<p>Consider what this means. London was not only a
city of foreign trade and a great port, but a city, also,
of many industries. It made an enormous quantity
of things; the very livelihood of the City was derived
from its trade and its industries. These once stopped,
the City perished. We have seen how the Roman
Augusta decayed and died. The people had no longer
any trade or any work, or any food. Therefore, the
City died. The same thing, from different causes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">{380}</a></span>
happened again. Trade
and work were suspended.
Therefore, the people
began to starve.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;"><a name="HUNGERFORD_MARKET" id="HUNGERFORD_MARKET"></a>
<img src="images/page_380.jpg" width="520" height="638" alt="HUNGERFORD MARKET" title="" />
<span class="caption">HUNGERFORD MARKET</span>
</div>

<p>Defoe, in his cataloguing
way, which is the
surest way of bringing a
thing home to every one's
understanding, enumerates
all the different trades
thrown out of work. That is to say, he catalogues all
the trades of London. Let it be understood that the
population of London was then about 350,000. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">{381}</a></span>
means about 100,000 working men of sixteen and upward.
All these craftsmen, living from week to week
upon their wages, with nothing saved, were turned out
of employment almost at the same time&mdash;they and
their families left to starve. Not only this, but clerks,
book-keepers, serving-men, footmen, maid-servants, and
apprentices were all turned into the streets together.
Add to this the small shopkeepers and retailers of
every kind, who live by their daily or weekly takings,
and we shall have a population of a quarter of a million
to keep.</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor, assisted by the Archbishop and
the two lords, Albemarle and Craven, began and maintained
a service of relief for these starving multitudes.
The King sent a thousand pounds a week; the City
gave six hundred pounds a week; merchants and rich
people sent thousands every week; it is said that a
hundred thousand pounds a week was contributed;
this seems too great a sum&mdash;yet a whole city out of
work! Employment was found for some of the men
as constables, drivers of the carts that carried the dead
to the burial-places, and so forth&mdash;and for the women
as nurses. And, thanks to the Mayor's exertions,
there was a plentiful supply of provisions during the
whole time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 522px;"><a name="CHEAPSIDE" id="CHEAPSIDE"></a>
<img src="images/page_382.jpg" width="522" height="278" alt="CHEAPSIDE" title="" />
<span class="caption">CHEAPSIDE</span>
</div>

<p>The disease continued to spread. It was thought
that dogs and cats carried about infection. All those
in the City were slaughtered. They even tried, for the
same reason, to poison the rats and mice, but apparently
failed. The necessity of going to market was a
great source of danger; people were warned to lift
their meat off the counter by iron hooks. Many
families isolated themselves. The journal of one such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">{382}</a></span>
household remains. The household, which lived in
Wood Street, Cheapside, consisted of the master, a
wholesale grocer, his wife, five children, two maid-servants,
two apprentices, a porter, and a boy. He
sent the boy to his friends in the country; he gave the
elder apprentice the rest of his time; and he stationed
his porter, Abraham, outside his door, there to sit
night and day. Every window was closed, and nothing
suffered to enter the house except at one upper
window, which was opened to admit necessaries, but
only with fumigation of gunpowder. At first the
Plague, while it raged about Holborn, Fleet Street,
and the Strand, came not within the City. This careful
man, however, fully expected it, and when it did
appear in July he locked himself up for good. Then
they knew nothing except what the porter told them,
and what they read in the Bills of Mortality. But all
day long the knell never ceased to toll. Very soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">{383}</a></span>
all the houses in the street were infected and visited
except their own. And when every day, and all day
long, he heard nothing but bad news, growing daily
worse, and when every night he heard the dismal bell
and the rumbling of the dead cart, and the voice of
the bellman crying, "Bring out your dead!" he began
to give up all for lost. First, however, he made
arrangements for the isolation of any one who should
be seized. Three times a day they held a service of
prayer; twice a week they observed a day of fasting;
one would think that this maceration of the flesh was
enough in itself to invite the Plague. Every morning
the father rose early and went round to each chamber
door asking how its inmates fared. When they replied
"Well," he answered "Give God thanks." Outside,
Abraham sat all day long, hearing from every passer-by
the news of the day, which grew more and more
terrifying, and passing it on to the upper window,
where it was received with a fiery fumigation. One
day Abraham came not. But his wife came. "Abraham,"
she said, "died of the Plague this morning,
and as for me, I have it also, and I am going home to
die. But first I will send another man to take my
husband's place." So the poor faithful woman crept
home and died, and that night with her husband was
thrown into a great pit with no funeral service except
the cursing and swearing of the rough fellows who
drove the cart. The other man came, but in a day or
two he also sickened and died. Then they had no
porter and no way of communicating with the outer
world. They remained prisoners, the whole family,
with the two maids, for five long months. I suppose
they must have devised some necessary communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">{384}</a></span>
with the outer world, or they would have
starved.</p>

<p>Presently the Plague began to decrease; its fury
was spent. But it was not until the first week of December
that this citizen ventured forth. Then he took
all his family to Tottenham for a change of air. One
would think they needed it after this long confinement,
and the monotony of their prison fare.</p>

<p>By this time the people were coming back fast&mdash;too
fast; because their return caused a fresh outbreak.
Then there was a grand conflagration of everything
which might harbor the plague&mdash;curtains, sheets,
blankets, hangings, stuffs, clothes&mdash;whatever there was
in which the accursed thing might linger. And every
house in which a case had occurred was scoured and
whitewashed, while the church-yards were all covered
with fresh earth at least a foot thick.</p>

<p>All this is a twice-told tale. But some tales may
be told again and again. Consider, for instance, apart
from the horror of this mighty pestilence, the loss and
injury inflicted upon the City. If it is true that a
hundred thousand perished, about half of them would
be the craftsmen, the skilled workmen who created
most of the wealth of London. How to replace these
men? They could never be replaced.</p>

<p>Consider, again, that London was the great port for
the reception and transmission of all the goods in the
whole country. The stoppage of trade in London
meant the stoppage of trade over the whole land.
The cloth-makers of the West, the iron-founders, the
colliers, the tin mines, the tanners, all were stopped,
all were thrown out of work.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 493px;"><a name="FLEET_STREET" id="FLEET_STREET"></a>
<img src="images/page_385.jpg" width="493" height="607" alt="FLEET STREET" title="" />
<span class="caption">FLEET STREET</span>
</div>

<p>Again, consider the ruin of families. How many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">{385}</a></span>
children of flourishing master-workmen, tradesmen,
and merchants were reduced to poverty by the death
of the father, and suddenly lowered to the level of
working-men, happy if they were still young enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">{386}</a></span>
to learn a craft? How many lost their credit in the
general stoppage of business? How many fortunes
were cast away when no debts could be collected,
and when the debtors themselves were all destroyed?
And in cases when children were too young to protect
themselves, how many were plundered of everything
when their parents were dead?</p>

<p>Defoe, writing what he had learned by conversation
with those who could remember this evil time,
speaks of strange extravagances on the part of those
who were infected. Very likely there were such
things. Not, however, that they were common, as
his story would have us believe. I prefer the picture
of the imprisoned citizen, which represents a city sitting
in sorrowful silence, the people crouching in their
houses in silence or in prayer, gazing helpless upon
each other, while the blue sky and the hot sun look
down upon them, and the Plague grows busier every
day.</p>

<p>When it abated at last, and the runaways went
back to town, Pepys among them, he notes the amazing
number of beggars. These poor creatures were
the widows or children of the craftsmen, or the craftsmen
themselves whose ruin we have just noted.</p>

<p>This was in January. The Plague, however, dragged
on. In the week ending March 1, 1666, there were
forty-two deaths from it. In the month of July it
was still present in London, and reported to be raging
at Colchester. In August, Pepys finds the house of
one of his friends in Fenchurch Street shut up with
the Plague, and it was said to be as bad as ever
at Greenwich. This was the last entry about it, because
in a week or two there was to happen an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">{387}</a></span>
event of even greater importance than this great
Plague.</p>

<p>Observe that this was the last appearance of the
Plague. Since 1665 it has never appeared in Europe,
except in Marseilles in the year 1720. It is not extinct.
It smoulders, like Vesuvius. There is nothing,
so far as can be understood, to prevent its reappearance
in London or anywhere else, unless it is the
improved sanitation of modern cities. For instance, it
was at Astrakhan in 1879. But it travelled no farther
west. It is generated in the broad miasmatic valley
of the Euphrates; there it lies, ready to be carried
about the world, the last gift of Babylon to the
nations. When that great city is built again, the centre
of commerce between Europe and the East, the
valley will once more be drained and cultivated, and
the Plague will die and be no more seen. But who
is to rebuild Babylon and to repeople the land of the
Assyrians?</p>

<p>There were two great Plagues of London in the
seventeenth century before this&mdash;the last and greatest&mdash;one
in 1603 and the other in 1625. I have before
me two contemporary tracts upon these plagues.
They illustrate what has been said of the Plague of
1665. Exactly the same things happened. In listening
either to him of 1603, or to him of 1625, one hears
the voice of 1665. I think that these tracts have
never before been quoted. Yet it is quite clear to me
that Defoe must have seen them both.</p>

<p>The first is called <i>The Wonderful Year</i>, 1603. The
author, who is anonymous, begins with weeping over
the death of Queen Elizabeth. This tribute paid,
with such exaggerated grief as belongs to his sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">{388}</a></span>
of loyalty, he rejoices, with equal extravagance, over
the accession of James. This brings him to his real
subject:</p>

<blockquote><p>A stiffe and freezing horror sucks vp the riuers of my blood:
my haire stands an ende with the panting of my braines: mine
eye balls are ready to start out, being beaten with the billowes
of my teares: out of my weeping pen does the inke mournfully
and more bitterly than gall drop on the pale-faced paper, even
when I do but thinke how the bowels of my sicke country
have bene torne. <i>Apollo</i>, therefore, and you bewitching siluer-tongd
<i>Muses</i>, get you gone: I inuocate none of your names.
Sorrow and truth, sit you on each side of me, whilst I am delivered
of this deadly burden: prompt me that I may utter
ruthfull and passionate condolement: arme my trembling hand,
that I may boldly rip up and anatomize the ulcerous body of
this <i>Anthropophagized</i> Plague: lend me art (without any counterfeit
shadowing) to paint and delineate to the life the whole
story of this mortall and pestiferous battaile. And you the
ghosts of those more (by many) than 40000, that with the virulent
poison of infection haue bene driuen out of your earthly dwellings:
you desolate hand-wringing widowes, that beate your
bosomes over your departing husbands: you wofully distracted
mothers that with disheueld haire falne into swounds, while you
lye kissing the insensible cold lips of your breathlesse infants:
you out-cast and down-troden orphans, that shall many a yeare
hence remember more freshly to mourne, when your mourning
garments shall looke olde and be forgotten; and you the <i>Genii</i>
of all those emptyed families, whose habitations are now among
the <i>Antipodes</i>; joine all your hands together, and with your
bodies cast a ring about me; let me behold your ghastly vizages,
that my paper may receiue their true pictures: <i>Eccho</i>
forth your grones through the hollow trunke of my pen, and
raine downe your gummy tears into mine incke, that even marble
bosomes may be shaken with terrour, and hearts of adamant
melt into compassion.</p></blockquote>

<span class="caption">BELOW BRIDGE</span>
</div>

<p>In this extravagant vein he plunges into the subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">{391}</a></span>
Death, he says, like stalking Tamberlaine, hath
pitched his tent in the suburbs; the Plague is muster-master
and marshal of the field; the main army is
a "mingle-mangle" of dumpish mourners, merry sextons,
hungry coffin-sellers, and nastie grave-makers.
All who could run away, he says, did run; some riding,
some on foot, some without boots, some in slippers,
by water, by land&mdash;"in shoals swom they." Then
the Plague invaded the City. Every house looked
like Bartholomew's Hospital; the people drank mithridatum
and dragon-water all day long; they stuffed
their ears and noses with rue and wormwood. Lazarus
lay at the door, but Dives was gone; there were
no dogs in the streets, for the Plague killed them all;
whole families were carried to the grave as if to bed.
"What became of our Phisitions in this massacre?
They hid their synodical heads as well as the prowdest;
for their phlebotomes, losinges, and electuaries,
with their diacatholicons, diacodions, amulets, and antidotes
had not so much strength to hold life and soule
together as a pot of Pindar's ale and a nutmeg." When
servants and prentices were attacked by the disease,
they were too often thrust out-of-doors by their masters,
and perished "in fields, in ditches, in common
cages, and under stalls." Then he begins to tell the
gruesome stories that belong to every time of Plague.
In this he is followed by Defoe, who most certainly
saw this pamphlet. What happened in 1603 also happened
in 1665. Those who could run away did so;
the physicians&mdash;who could do nothing&mdash;ran; the rich
merchants ran; there was a general stoppage of trade;
there was great suffering among the poor; those
who dared to sit together, sat in the taverns drinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">{392}</a></span>
till they lost their fears. His stories told, the writer
concludes:</p>

<blockquote><p>I could fill a whole uolume, and call it the second part of
the hundred mery tales, onely with such ridiculous stuffe as
this of the Justice; but <i>Dii meliora</i>; I haue better matters to
set my wits about: neither shall you wring out of my pen
(though you lay it on the racke) the villainies of that damnd
Keeper, who killd all she kept; it had bene good to haue made
her Keeper of the common Jayle, and the holes of both Counters;
for a number lye there that wish to be rid out of this
motley world; shee would haue tickled them and turned them
ouer the thumbs. I will likewise let the Church-warden in
<i>Thames-street</i> sleep (for hees now past waking) who being requested
by one of his neighbors to suffer his wife or child
(that was then dead) to lye in the Church-yard, answered in
a mocking sort, he keept that lodging for himselfe and his
household: and within three days after was driuen to hide his
head in a hole himself. Neither will I speake a word of a poore
boy (seruant to a Chandler) dwelling thereabouts, who being
struck to the heart by sicknes, was first caryed away by water,
to be left anywhere; but landing being denyed by an army
of brownebill men, that kept the shore, back againe was he
brought, and left in an out-celler, where lying groueling and
groaning on his face, among fagots (but not one of them set
on fire to comfort him), there continued all night, and dyed
miserably for want of succor. Nor of another poore wretch, in
the Parish of St. <i>Mary Oueryes</i>, who being in the morning
throwne, as the fashion is, into a graue vpon a heap of carcases,
that kayd for their complement, was found in the after-noone
gasping and gaping for life: but by these tricks, imagining
that many thousand haue bene turned wrongfully off the
ladder of life, and praying that <i>Derick</i> or his executors, may
liue to do those a good turne, that haue done so to others:
<i>Hic finis Priami</i>; heeres an end of an old song.</p></blockquote>

<p>The second tract was written by one whose Christian
name is surely Jeremiah. It is called <i>Vox Civitatis</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">{393}</a></span>
It is the Lamentation of London under the
Plague. The City mourns her departed merchants.
"Issachar stands still for want of work." Her children
are starving; her apprentices, "the children of knights
and justices of the county," are rated with beggars,
and buried in the highway like malefactors. As for
the clergy, they did not forsake their flocks; they
sent them away&mdash;all who could go&mdash;before they themselves
fled. The physicians and the surgeons have
fled. Yet some have remained&mdash;parsons, physicians,
and surgeons. The Lord Mayor, too, remained at his
post. Then he argues that no one, in whatever station,
has the right to desert his post. None are useless.
He declaims against the inhumanity of those
who refuse shelter to a stricken man, and he calls upon
those who have food to return. The whole composition
is filled with pious ejaculations; it certainly is
the work of some city clergyman. London is stricken
for her sins; yet there is mercy in the chastisement.
The author is always finding consolation in the
thought that the punishment will lead to reformation.
Yet the work is a cry of suffering, of pity, and of indignation.
The writer does not relate, he alludes to
what everybody knows; yet he makes us see the
workshops closed, 'Change deserted, churches shut, all
the better class fled, prentices thrust out to die in the
streets, the people with no work and no money, the
servants left to guard the warehouses dead; even in
Cheapside not a place where one can change a purse
of gold; "Watling Street like an empty Cloyster."
The Plague is terrible, but it is the chastisement of
the Lord. He hath taken the City into His own
hands; that may be borne; the worst, the most terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">{394}</a></span>
thing is the desertion of the City and the people
by the masters; the abandonment of those dependent
upon their employers&mdash;this is the burden of the cry.
To those who study the gleams and glimpses of
Plague-time in these papers, the worst suffering in
every time of pestilence was caused by the cessation
of work and of trade. The master gone, the servants
had no work and no wages&mdash;how were the children to
be fed?</p>

<p>With one little touch of human nature the tract
concludes. The writer was a scholar; he is jealous
concerning his style. "If," he says, "this Declaration
wants Science, or that Eloquence that might beseem
me, consider my Trouble, the Absence of my Orators,
the shutting up of my Libraries, so that I was content
with a common Secretary." It is <i>Vox Civitatis</i> London
that speaks; her libraries are those of St. Paul's,
Zion College, Gresham College, Whittington College;
the "common Secretary" is the writer. Such is his
proud humility&mdash;a "common Secretary!"</p>

<hr style='margin-left:27.5%; width:45%'/>

<p>Now for another twice-told tale.</p>

<p>The last cross had not been removed from the last
infected house, the last person dead of the Plague
had not been buried, before the Great Fire of London
broke out and purged the plague-stricken city from
end to end.</p>

<p>Three great fires had destroyed London before this
of the year 1666, viz., in 962, in 1087, which swept
away nearly the whole of the City, and in 1212, when
a great part of Southwark and of the City north of
the bridge was destroyed.</p>

<p>This fire began early in the morning of Sunday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">{395}</a></span>
September 2d. It broke out at the house of one Farryner,
a baker in Pudding Lane, Thames Street. All
the houses in that lane, and, one supposes, in all the
narrow lanes and courts about this part of the City,
were of wood, pitched without; the lane was narrow,
and the projecting stories on either side nearly met at
the top. The baker's house was full of faggots and
brushwood, so that the fire instantly broke out into
full fury and spread four ways at once. The houses
stood very thick in this, the most densely populated
part of the City. In the narrow lanes north and
south of Thames Street lived those who made their
living as stevedores, watermen, porters, carriers, and
so forth; in Thames Street itself, on either side, were
warehouses filled with oil, pitch, and tar, wine, brandy,
and such inflammable things, so that by six o'clock
on Sunday morning all Fish Street was in flames, and
the fire spreading so fast that the people barely had
time to remove their goods. As it drew near to a
house they hurriedly loaded a cart with the more valuable
effects and carried them off to another house
farther away, and then to another, and yet another.
Some placed their goods in churches for safety, as if
the flames would respect a consecrated building. The
booksellers, for instance, of Paternoster Row carried
all their books into the crypt of St. Paul's, thinking
that there, at least, would be a safe place, if any in
the whole world. Who could look at those strong
stone pillars with the strong arched roof and suspect
that the stones would crumble like sand beneath the
fierce heat which was playing upon them? All that
Sunday was spent in moving goods out of houses before
the flames caught them; the river was covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">{396}</a></span>
with barges and lighters laden with furniture. Pepys
watched the fire from Bankside. "We stayed till, it
being darkish, we saw the fire as only one entire arch
of fire from this to the other side of the bridge, and in
a bow up the hill for an arch of above a mile long; it
made me weep to see it. The churches, houses, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">{397}</a></span>
all on fire and flaming at once; and a horrid noise the
flames made, and the crackling of houses at their
ruin." On Monday morning Pepys puts his bags of
gold and his plate into a cart with all his best things,
and drove off to Sir William Rider's, at Bethnal Green.
His friend, Sir W. Batten, not knowing how to move
his wine, dug a pit in his garden and put it there. In
this pit, also, Pepys placed the papers of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>On Wednesday he walked into the town over the
hot ashes. Fenchurch Street, Gracechurch Street,
Lombard Street, Cheapside, he found in dust. Of
the Exchange nothing standing of all the statues but
that of Sir Thomas Gresham&mdash;a strange survival. On
Saturday he went to see the ruins of St. Paul's: "A
miserable sight; all the roofs fallen, and the body of
the Quire fallen into St. Faith's; Paul's school, also
Ludgate and Fleet Street."</p>

<p>The fire was stayed at length by blowing up houses
at the Temple Church, at Pie Corner, Smithfield
(where the figure of a boy still stands to commemorate
the fact), at Aldersgate, Cripplegate, and the
upper part of Bishopsgate Street. It had consumed
five-sixths of the City, together with a great piece beyond
the western gates. It had covered an area of
436 acres, viz., 387 acres within the walls, and 73 without;
it had destroyed 132,000 dwelling-houses, St.
Paul's Cathedral, eighty-nine parish churches, four of
the City gates, Sion College, the Royal Exchange, the
old Grey Friars Church, the Chapel of St. Thomas
of Acon, and an immense number of great houses,
schools, prisons, and hospitals. The area covered,
roughly speaking, an oblong nearly a mile and a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">{398}</a></span>
in length by half a mile in breadth. The value of
the property destroyed was estimated at £10,000,000.
There is no such fire of any great city on record, unless
it is the burning of Rome under Nero.</p>

<p>Their city being thus destroyed, the citizens lost
no time, but set to work manfully to rebuild it. The
rebuilding of London is a subject of some obscurity.
One thing is quite certain: that as soon as the embers
were cool enough to enable the people to walk among
them, they returned, and began to find out the sites
of their former houses. It is also certain that it took
more than two years to clear away the tottering walls
and the ruins.</p>

<p>It was at first proposed to build again on a new
plan; Sir Christopher Wren prepared one plan, and
Sir John Evelyn another. Both plans were excellent,
symmetrical and convenient. Had either been adopted,
the City of London would have been as artificial
and as regular as a new American town, or the City of
Turin. Very happily, while the Lord Mayor and aldermen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">{399}</a></span>
were considering the matter, the people had
already begun to build. A most fortunate thing it
was that the City rose again on its old lines, with its
winding streets and narrow lanes. At first the houseless
people, 200,000 in number, camped out in Moorfields,
just north of the City. Very happily, these
fields, which had long been a swamp or fen intersected
by ditches, a place of pasture, kennels, and windmills,
had been drained by the City in 1606, and were now
laid out in pleasant walks, a place of resort for summer
evenings, a wrestling and cudgel playing-ground,
and a ground for the muster of the militia. Here
they set up tents and cottages; here they presently
began to build two-storied houses of brick.</p>

<p>As they had no churches, they set up "tabernacles,"
whether on the site of the old churches or in Moorfields
does not appear. As they had no Exchange,
they used Gresham College for the purpose; the same
place did duty for the Guildhall; the Excise Office
was removed to Southampton Fields, near Bedford
House; the General Post-office was taken to Brydges
Street, Covent Garden; the Custom-house to Mark
Lane; Doctors' Commons to Exeter House, Strand.
The part of the town wanted for the shipping and
foreign trade was first put up. And thus the town,
in broken-winged fashion, renewed its old life.</p>

<p>On September 18th the Houses of Parliament created
a Court of Judicature for settling the differences
which were sure to arise between landlord and tenants,
and between owners of land, as to boundaries
and other things. The Justices of the Court of King's
Bench and Common Pleas, with the Barons of the
Exchequer, were the judges of the Court. So much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">{400}</a></span>
satisfaction did they give that the grateful City caused
their portraits to be placed in Guildhall, where, I believe,
they may be seen to this day.</p>

<p>In order to enable the churches, prisons, and public
buildings to be rebuilt, a duty was laid upon coals.
This duty was also to enable the City to enlarge the
streets, take over ground for quays, and other useful
purposes. Nothing, however, seems to have been
granted for the rebuilding of private houses.</p>

<p>The building of the churches took a long time to
accomplish. The first to be completed was that of
St. Dunstan's in the East, the tower of which is Sir
Christopher Wren's; the body of the church, which
has since been pulled down, was by another hand.
That was built two years after the Fire. Six years
after the Fire another church was finished; seven
years after three more; eight years after three more;
ten years after five, and so on, dragging along until
the last two of those rebuilt&mdash;for a great many were
not put up again&mdash;were finished in the year 1697,
thirty-one years after the Fire.</p>

<span class="caption">JOHN BUNYAN&#39;S MEETING-HOUSE IN ZOAR STREET</span>
</div>

<p>Within four years the rebuilding of the City was
nearly completed. Ten thousand houses were built, a
great many companies' halls, and nearly twenty churches.
One who writes in the year 1690 (<i>Angliæ Metropolis,
or, The Present State of London</i>) says, "As if the
Fire had only purged the City, the buildings are infinitely
more beautiful, more commodious, more solid
(the three main virtues of all edifices) than before.
They have made their streets much more large and
straight, paved on each side with smooth hewn stone,
and guarded the same with many massy posts for the
benefit of foot-passengers; and whereas before they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">{401}</a></span>
dwelt in low, dark, wooden houses, they now live in
lofty, lightsome, uniform, and very stately brick buildings."
This is great gain. And yet, looking at the
houses outside Staple Inn and at the old pictures, at
what loss of picturesqueness was this gain acquired?
The records are nearly silent as to the way in which
the people were affected by the Fire. It is certain,
however, that where the Plague ruined hundreds of
families, the Fire ruined thousands. Thirteen thousand
houses were burned down; many of these were
houses harboring two or three families, for 200,000
were rendered homeless. Some of them were families
of the lower working class, the river-side laborers and
watermen, who would suffer little more than temporary
inconvenience, and the loss of their humble "sticks."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">{402}</a></span>
But many of them were substantial merchants, their
warehouses filled with wine, oil, stuffs, spices, and all
kinds of merchandise; warehouses and contents all
gone&mdash;swept clean away&mdash;and with them the whole
fortune of the trader. And there were the retailers,
whose stock in trade, now consumed, represented all
they had in the world. And there were the master-workmen,
their workshops fitted with such machinery
and tools as belonged to their craft and the materials
for their work&mdash;all gone&mdash;all destroyed. Where was
the money found to replace these treasures of imported
goods? Who could refurnish his shop for the
draper? Who could rebuild and fill his warehouse
for the merchant? Who could give back his books
to the bookseller? No one&mdash;the stock was all gone.</p>

<p>The prisoners for debt, as well as those who were
imprisoned for crime, regained their freedom when
the prisons were burned down. Could the debts be
proved against them when the papers were all destroyed?</p>

<p>The tenant whose rent was in arrears was safe, for
who could prove that he had not paid?</p>

<p>All debts were wiped clean off the slate. There
were no more mortgages, no more promissory bills to
meet, no more drafts of honor. Debts as well as
property were all destroyed together. The money-lender
and the borrower were destroyed together.
The schools were closed&mdash;for how long? The almshouses
were burned down&mdash;what became of the poor
old bedesmen and bedeswomen? The City charities
were suspended&mdash;what became of the poor? The
houses were destroyed&mdash;what became of rents and
tithes and taxes?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">{403}</a></span></p>

<p>The Fire is out at last; the rain has quenched the
last sparks; the embers have ceased to smoke; those
walls which have not fallen totter and hang trembling
ready to fall. I see men standing about singly; the
tears run down their cheeks; two hundred years ago,
if we had anything to cry about, we were not ashamed
to cry without restraint; they are dressed in broadcloth,
the ruffles are of lace, they look like reputable
citizens. Listen&mdash;one draws near another. "Neighbor,"
he says, "a fortnight ago, before this stroke,
whether of God or of Papist, I had a fair shop on this
spot." "And I also, good friend," said the other, "as
you know." "My shop," continued the first, "was
stocked with silks and satins, kid gloves, lace ruffles
and neckties, shirts, and all that a gentleman or a gentlewoman
can ask for. The stock was worth a thousand
pounds. I turned it over six or seven times a
year at least. And my profit was four hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">{404}</a></span>
pounds." "As for me," said the other, "I was in a
smaller way, as you know. Yet such as it was, my
fortune was all in it, and out of my takings I could
call two hundred pounds a year my own." "Now is
it all gone," said the first. "All gone," the other repeated,
fetching a sigh. "And now, neighbor, unless
the company help, I see nothing for it but we must
starve." "Must starve," the other repeated. And so
they separated, and went divers ways, and whether
they starved or whether they received help, and rose
from the ashes with new house and newly stocked
shop, I know not. Says Dryden on the Fire:</p>

</div></div>

<p>I think there must have been a return for a while
to a primitive state of barter and exchange. Not
quite, because every man carried out of the Fire such
money as he had. Pepys, for instance, placed his bags
of gold in a cart and drove it himself, "in my night
gown," to a friend at rural Bethnal Green. But there
could have been very little money in comparison with
the millions invested in the merchandise destroyed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">{405}</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 746px;"><a name="LONDON_AFTER_THE_FIRE" id="LONDON_AFTER_THE_FIRE"></a>
<img src="images/page_405.jpg" width="746" height="462" alt="LONDON AFTER THE FIRE" title="" />
<span class="caption">LONDON AFTER THE FIRE</span>

<p>The most pressing want was food. The better sort
had money enough for present needs, the poorer class
had to be maintained. The corporation set thousands
to work clearing rubbish, carting it way, pulling
down the shaky walls, and throwing open the streets.
When the quays were cleared, the business of the
port was resumed. Then the houses and the shops
began to rise. The former were built on credit, and
the latter stocked on credit. Very likely the companies
or the corporation itself became to a large extent
security, advancing money to the builders and
making easy terms about rent. Naturally, it was a
time of enormous activity, every trader making up for
lost time, and especially such trades as concerned the
building, furnishing, or fitting of houses&mdash;a time of
good wages and constant work. Indeed, it is stated
that the prosperity of the West Country cloth-making
business was never so great as during the years following
the Fire, which had destroyed such a prodigious
quantity of material. The City in time resumed its
old aspect; the ruined thousands had sunk out of
sight; and nothing could replace the millions that
had been lost.</p>

<p>The manners of the City differed little in essentials
from those of Queen Elizabeth's time. Let us note,
however, two or three points, still keeping the unspeakable
court out of sight, and confining ourselves
as much as possible to the City. Here are a few
notes which must not be taken as a finished picture of
the time.</p>

<p>It was a great time for drinking. Even grave divines
drank large quantities of wine. Pepys is constantly
getting "foxed" with drink; on one occasion he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">{408}</a></span>
afraid of reading evening prayers lest the servants
should discover his condition. Of course they did
discover it, and went to bed giggling; but as they
kept no diary the world never learned it. London
drank freely. Pepys tells how one lady, dining at
Sir W. Bullen's, drank at one draught a pint and a
half of white wine. They all went to church a great
deal, and had fast days on every occasion of doubt
and difficulty; on the first Sunday in the year the
longest Psalm in the book (I suppose the 119th) was
given out after the sermon. This took an hour to say
or sing, and all the while the sexton went about the
church making a collection. On Valentine's Day the
married men took each other's wives for valentines.
Public wrestling matches were held, followed by bouts
with the cudgels.</p>

<p>They still carried on the sport of bull and bear baiting,
and on one occasion they baited a savage horse
to death. That is, they attempted it, but he drove off
all the dogs, and the people insisting on his death,
they stabbed him to death. The King issued two
patents for theatres, one to Henry Killigrew, at Drury
Lane, whose company called themselves The King's
Servants; the other to Sir William Davenant, of Dorset
Gardens, whose company was The Duke's Servants.
There were still some notable superstitions left. These
are illustrated by the remedies advertised for the plague
and other diseases. A spider, for instance, placed in
a nutshell and wrapped in silk will cure ague. They
believed in the malignant influence of the planets.
One evening at a dancing house half a dozen boys
and girls were taken suddenly ill. Probably they had
swallowed some poisonous stuff. They were supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">{409}</a></span>
to be planet-struck. And, of course, they believed
in astrology and in chiromancy, the latter of
which has again come into fashion.</p>

<p>Saturday was the day of duns. Creditors then went
about collecting their money. In the autumn the
merchants rode out into the country and looked after
their country customers.</p>

<p>The social fabric of the time cannot be understood
without remembering that certain nominal distinctions
of our generation were then real things, and
gave a man consideration. Thus, there were no peers
left living in the City. But there were a few baronets
and many knights. After them in order came
esquires, gentlemen, and commoners. Those were
entitled to the title of esquire who were gentlemen
of good estate, not otherwise dignified, counsellors-at-law,
physicians and holders of the King's commission.
Everybody remembers Pepys's delight at being for the
first time, then newly made Secretary to the Admiralty,
addressed as esquire, and his irrepressible pride at
being followed into church by a page. A younger
brother could call himself a gentleman, and this, I
take it, whether he was in trade or not. About this
time, however, younger sons began leaving off going
to the City and embarking in trade, and that separation
of the aristocracy from the trade of the country,
which made the former a distinct caste and has lasted
almost until the present day, first began. It is now,
however, so far as one can perceive the signs of the
times, fast disappearing. The younger son, in fact,
began to enter the army, the navy, or the Church.
From the middle of the seventeenth century till the
battle of Waterloo, war in Europe was almost continuous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">{410}</a></span>
A gentleman could offer his sword anywhere
and was accepted. There were English gentlemen
in the service of Austria, Russia, Sweden&mdash;even
in that of France or Spain. Unfortunately,
however, in this country we generally had need of all
the gentlemen we could find to command our own
armies. The title of gentleman was also conceded to
attorneys, notaries, proctors, and other lesser degrees
of the law; merchants, surgeons, tradesmen, authors,
artists, architects, and the like, had then, and have
now, no rank of any kind in consideration of their
employments.</p>

<p>Tea, which at the Restoration was quite beyond
the means of private persons, became rapidly cheaper
and in daily use among the better class in London,
though not in the country. Thus, in Congreve's "Way
of the World," Mrs. Millamant claims to be "Sole
Empress of my tea-table." Her lover readily consents
to her drinking tea if she agrees to a stipulation
which shows that the love of tea was as yet more
fashionable than real, since it could be combined with
that of strong drinks. He says that he must banish
from her table "foreign forces, auxiliaries to the tea-table,
such as orange brandy, aniseed, cinnamon, citron,
and Barbadoes water, together with ratafia and
the most noble spirit of clary."</p>

<p>The favorite places of resort in the City were the
galleries of the Royal Exchange, filled with shops for
the sale of gloves, ribbons, laces, fans, scent, and such
things. The shops were kept by young women who,
like the modern bar-maid, added the attraction of a
pretty face to the beauty of their wares. The piazza
of Covent Garden was another favorite place, but this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">{411}</a></span>
with Spring Gardens, Vauxhall, was outside the City.
The old desecration of Paul's was to a great extent
stopped by the erection of the West Porch, designed
for those who met here for purposes of business.</p>

<p>Coffee-houses were first set up at this time, and at
once became indispensable to the citizens, who before
had had no other place of evening resort than the tavern.
The City houses were "Dick's" and the "Rainbow,"
in Fleet Street; "Tom's," of Birchin Lane (not
to speak of the more classic "Tom's," of Covent Garden).
Nearly all the old inns of the City have now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">{412}</a></span>
been destroyed. Fifty years ago many were still
standing, with their galleries and their open courts.
Such were the "Bell," of Warwick Lane; the "Belle
Sauvage," of Ludgate Hill; the "Blossom," Laurence
Lane; the "Black Lion," Whitefriars Street; the
"Four Swans," Bishopsgate Street; the "Saracen's
Head," Friday Street, and many others.</p>

<p>It is, I suppose, pretty clear that the songs collected
by Tom d'Urfey are a fair representation of
the delectable and edifying ditties sung in taverns, and
when the society was "mixed." It would be easy to
preach against the wickedness of the times which could
permit the singing of such songs, but in reality they
are no worse than the songs of the preceding generation,
to which, indeed, many of them belong. And,
besides, it does not appear that the better sort of people
regaled themselves with this kind of song at all,
and even in this collection there are a great many
which are really beautiful. The following pretty lines
are taken almost at random from one of the volumes
of the <i>Pills to Purge Melancholy</i>. They are called a
"Description of Chloris:"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Many of the poems are patriotic battle-pieces; some
present the shepherd in the usual fashion as consumed
by the ardor of his love, being wishing and pining,
sighing and weeping. That seeming extravagance of
passion&mdash;that talk of flames and darts&mdash;was not entirely
conventional:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How charming Phillis is, how fair!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O that she were as willing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ease my wounded heart of care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make her eyes less killing!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was not only exaggeration. I am quite certain that
men and women were far less self-governed formerly
than now: when, for instance, they were in love, they
were much more in love than now. The passion possessed
them and transported them and inflamed them.
Their pangs of jealousy tore them to pieces; they must
get their mistress or they will go mad. Nay, it is only
of late&mdash;say during the last hundred years&mdash;that we
have learned to restrain passions of any kind. Love,
jealousy, envy, hatred, were far fiercer emotions under
the Second Charles&mdash;nay, even under the Second
George&mdash;than they are with us. Anger was far more
common. It does not seem as if men and women,
especially of the lower classes, ever attempted in the
least to restrain their passions. To be sure they could
at once have it out in a fight&mdash;a thing which excuses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">{414}</a></span>
wrath. To inquire into the causes of the universal
softening of manners would take us too far. But we
may note as a certain fact that passions are more restrained
and not so overwhelming: that love is milder,
wrath more governed, and that manners are softened
for us.</p>

<p>One must not, again, charge the City at this time
with being more than commonly pestered by rogues.
The revelations of the Elizabethan moralists, and the
glimpses we get of mediæval rogues, forbid this accusation.
At the same time there was a good standing
mass of solid wickedness. Contemporary literature
proves this, if any proof were wanted, abundantly.
There is a work of some literary value called the <i>Life
of Meriton Latroon</i>, in which is set forth an immense
quantity of rogueries. Among other things the writer
shows the tricks of trade, placing his characters in
many kinds of shops, so as to give his experiences in
each. We are thus enabled to perceive that there
were sharpers and cheats in respectable-looking shops
then, as now. And there seems no reason to believe
that the cheats were in greater proportion to the honest
men than they are now. Besides the tricks of the
masters, the honest Meriton Latroon shows us the
ways of the London prentice, which were highly promising
for the future of the City. He robbed his master
as much as he dared: he robbed him of money;
he robbed him of stuffs and goods; he ruined the
maids; he belonged to a club which met on Saturday
nights, when the master was at his country-box, and
exchanged, for the common good, the robberies of the
week. After this they feasted and drank with young
Bona Robas, who stole from them the money they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">{415}</a></span>
stolen from their shops. It is a beautiful picture, and
would by some moralists be set down to the evil example
of King Charles, who is generally held responsible
for the whole of the wickedness of the people during
his reign. But these prentices knew nothing of the
court, and the thing had been going on all through
the Protectorate, and, for that matter, I dare say as
far back as the original institution of apprenticeship.
One would fain hope that not all the City apprentices
belonged to this club. Otherwise, one thinks that
the burning of London ought to have been the end
of London.</p>

<p>The worst vice of the age seems to have been gambling,
which was as prevalent in the City as at the
court; that is to say, one does not accuse sober merchants
of gambling, but in every tavern there were
cards and dice, and they were in use all day long. Now,
wherever there is gambling there are thieves, sharpers,
and cheats by profession, and in every age these gentry
enjoy their special names, whether of opprobrium or
of endearment. They were then called Huffs, Rooks,
Pads, Pimpinios, Philo Puttonists, Ruffins, Shabbaroons,
Rufflers, and other endearing terms&mdash;not that
the number of the names proves the extent of the
evil. Whatever they were called, the whole object of
their lives&mdash;their only way of living&mdash;was to trick, extort,
or coax money out of flats. Very often they
were gentlemen by birth, younger sons of good families,
who scorned any honest way of making their
living. By their good manners, fashionable appearance,
pleasing address, and known connections they
often succeeded in getting hold of unsuspecting gentlemen
from the country. It is the old, old story.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">{416}</a></span>
Captain Hawk is always on the lookout for Master
Pigeon, and too often catches him. The story that
Thackeray has told belongs not to one period, but
to all. Of course there was the lower class of rogues:
the sturdy beggar, the man who cannot work because
he has in his blood the taint of whole generations
of idleness; the nomad, who would die unless
he were always roving about the country; the outcast,
who delights in pitting his wits against the law. A
few of these I have chosen from the long lists. They
are as follows:</p>

<p>The "Ruffler," who pretended to be an old soldier
of Naseby or Marston Moor.</p>

<p>The "Angler," who carried a stick with a hook at
the end of it, and found it useful when the window
was left open.</p>

<p>The "Wild Rogue," used for boys and girls, children
of thieves, who made a good living for their parents
by hanging about the doors of crowded churches,
and cutting off gold buttons from the coats of the
merchants.</p>

<p>The "Clapperdozen," a woman who begged about
the streets with stolen children.</p>

<p>The "Abram Man," a sham madman.</p>

<p>The "Whip Jack," a counterfeit sailor who pretended
to be shipwrecked.</p>

<p>The "Mumpus," who pretended to be a decayed
merchant or a sequestered clergyman.</p>

<p>The "Dommerer," who shammed dumb.</p>

<p>Let us turn from general statements to the consideration
of a single family. That of Samuel Pepys
might be taken as an example, and his Journal is by no
means well-trodden and familiar ground. In fact, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">{417}</a></span>
is generally read in bits, for half an hour's amusement.
Yet it is better to take a case not before the public at
all. Besides, even a minute diary such as that of
Pepys, kept day by day, leaves, when you come to
construct the daily life out of it, great gaps here and
there. Less literary documents may sometimes yield
richer results. Even the most careful diarist scorns to
speak of details. For them we must look into the
humble papers of the household. For instance, I have
before me a bundle of documents on which I lighted
by accident, containing the household accounts of a
respectable family for the years 1677-1679, and I propose
by means of these accounts to reproduce the
household daily life of a bourgeois well-to-do family
of the time.</p>

<p>This family consisted of the master, the mistress, and
"Mr. Arthur," who was probably the master's brother.
The two former were at this time a young married
couple, whose joys and anxieties are presently increased
by the arrival of a baby. Their residence is a short
distance from London, and their way of life may be
taken to illustrate that of the general run of London
citizens. The occupation of the master is not stated,
but he appears to be a man following no profession or
trade: perhaps a gentleman with a small estate. They
seem to have kept no horses, so that their means were
certainly narrow. Their nearest market-town was
Hertford, whither they went by coach (fare one shilling)
to buy what they wanted. Their house-keeping
was conducted with an eye to economy, yet there is
no stint, and occasionally there occurs an entry&mdash;quite
inexplicable&mdash;of wild extravagance. They lived
in the country, about fifteen miles from London, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">{418}</a></span>
presumably had a garden, yet they did not grow
enough vegetables, herbs, and fruit for their own consumption.
The household consisted, besides the family
and the nurse, of a cook, two maids, and a gardener,
or man of all work. The accounts are partly kept by
the mistress and partly by a servant&mdash;perhaps a house-keeper.
Remembering that Pepys consented to receive
his sister "Pall" into his house only on the footing
of a servant, the keeper of the accounts may very
well have been a poor relation.</p>

<p>The rent of the house was £26 a year. It contained
two sitting-rooms and four bedrooms, with a kitchen.
The parlor, or best sitting-room, was hung with five
pieces of fine tapestry; the other sitting-room with
gray linsey-woolsey and gilt leather; the bedrooms
had hangings of striped cloth. Curtains of green cloth
with a green carpet decorated the parlor; the other
rooms had green, say, or "sad color" striped curtains.
The best bedroom contained a magnificent "wrought"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
carved&mdash;bedstead with a canopy, curtains, a valance,
and chairs all of the same material. There were
three other bedrooms, one for Mr. Arthur, one for the
nurse and the baby, unless they slept at the foot of the
big bed, and one for the maids. The gardener slept
out of the house. The furniture of the parlor consisted
of one central table&mdash;the dining-table&mdash;a table
with a drawer, a cupboard, a clock case, a leather chair,
a plush chair, six green cloth chairs, and two green
stools. The carpet and curtains have been already
mentioned; there were no pictures, no cabinets, no
book-shelves, no mirrors, no sofas. The other room
was more simply furnished with a Spanish table, a
plain table, and a few chairs. Two of the bedrooms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">{419}</a></span>
had looking-glasses, and there was a very generous
provision of feather-beds, bolsters, pillows, and blankets,
which speaks of comfort for the night.</p>

<p>The inventory of the kitchen furniture is, unfortunately,
incomplete. There is no mention at all made
of any china-ware. Yet porcelain was by this time in
common use. It was made at Bow and at Chelsea.
In middle-class houses the master and mistress used
it at table, while servants and children still had pewter
or even wooden platters. The inventory speaks of
porringers, doubtless of wood, of pewter candlesticks&mdash;there
are no brass candlesticks&mdash;of a three-pint
pewter pot, of a great and little bowl&mdash;for possets and
hot spiced ale&mdash;and of wooden platters. Nothing is
said of silver; there are no silver cups&mdash;in the century
before this no respectable householder was without
one silver mazer at least; there are no silver candlesticks;
there is no mention of forks. Now the two-pronged
fork of steel was made in Sheffield certainly
in the middle of the century. It would be curious if
the ordinary household still kept up the old fashion of
eating without forks so late as 1677.</p>

<p>Such was the equipment of the house, one sitting-room,
and one bedroom handsomely, the rest plainly,
furnished.</p>

<p>The first thing which strikes one in the accounts is
the enormous consumption of beer. The household
drank two kilderkins, or thirty-six gallons, of beer
every week! One hundred and forty-four quarts a
week! Twenty-one quarts a day! It means nearly
three quarts a head. This seems impossible. There
must have been some external assistance. Perhaps
the master had some kind of farm, or employed other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">{420}</a></span>
servants. But it is not really impossible. We must
remember that there was no tea, that people would
not drink water if they could get anything else, and
that small beer was the national beverage, taken with
every meal, and between meals, and that the allowance
was practically <i>à discretion</i>. It was certainly quite possible,
and even common, for a man to drink three
quarts a day. A hundred years later Benjamin Franklin
describes the daily beer-drinking in a London
printing-house. The men took a pint before breakfast,
a pint with breakfast, a pint between breakfast
and dinner, a pint at dinner, a pint at six, and a pint
when work was knocked off. This makes three quarts,
without counting any beer that might be taken in the
evening. In the well-known and often-quoted account
of Mr. Hastings (Hutchin's <i>History of Dorsetshire</i>),
who lived over a hundred years, it is recorded of him
that he would take his glass or two of wine or strong
ale at dinner, but that he always had beside him his
great "tun-glass" filled with small beer, which he
stirred with rosemary. But, even if the men drank
three quarts a day, the women could not.</p>

<p>In addition to the small beer, which cost threepence
a gallon, there are continual entries of ale at twopence
a quart. This was bought at the tavern. There were
many kinds of ale, as cock ale, college ale, wormwood
ale, sage ale, and scurvy-grass ale, some of them
medicated, to be taken at certain seasons of the year.
There was also wine, but not much. Occasionally
they bought a cask&mdash;a tierce of forty-two gallons&mdash;and
bottled it at home. The kind of wine is not
stated. Sometimes they send out to the nearest
tavern for a bottle, and it cost a shilling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">{421}</a></span></p>

<p>The accounts seem to set down everything wanted
for the conduct of a house; every week, however, there
is an unexplained item, called "cook's bill." This, I
think, is the separate account of the servants' table.
The "cook's bill" amounts every week to a good sum,
a little above or a little below a pound. Perhaps it
contained the wages as well as the board. The amount
of food entered certainly does not seem enough for
the servants as well as the family.</p>

<p>During the winter they bought no fresh beef at all.
In November they bought great pieces, thirty, forty,
even seventy pounds at a time. This was for the
pickling-tub. Boiled beef played a great part in the
winter's dinners. If they drank enormous quantities
of beer they managed with very little bread. I find
that, taking ten consecutive weeks, they spent no more
than eight shillings upon bread. The price of wheat
was then subject to very great variations. For example:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">In the year</td><td align="left">1675</td><td align="left">it was</td><td align="left">£3</td><td align="left">4<i>s.</i></td><td align="left">8<i>d.</i></td><td align="left">the quarter.</td></tr>

</table></div>


<p>In other words, it was dearer in 1678 than it is in
1890, and that when the purchasing power of money
was four times what it is now. Now it may be reckoned
that in a house where there are children the
average consumption of bread is at this day ten
pounds weight a head. In this household of seven
the average consumption was no more than eight
pounds altogether. Setting aside the servants, the
family had no more than two pounds of bread apiece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">{422}</a></span>
every week, or four and a half ounces a day, which is
one slice not too thick. Oat cake, however, they used
in good quantity, so that the bread would be considered
as a luxury.</p>

<p>The old vice of the English in eating vast quantities
of meat to very little bread or vegetable could no
longer be a reproach to them. By this time there was
abundance of vegetables of every kind. We are especially
told that in the serving of the boiled beef
great quantities of vegetables, carrots, parsnips, cauliflowers,
cabbage, spinach, beans, peas, etc., were served
with it, and so also with other meat. There is no
mention of potatoes, though one had always thought
that they were firmly established in the country by
this time. Their own garden was not able to furnish
them with enough fruit or vegetables, which they
have to buy constantly. They also buy nosegays in
the summer.</p>

<p>The prices of things in the time of Charles the
Second, may be found interesting. In considering
them, remember, as stated above, that the general purchasing
power of money was then four times that of
the present time. A leg of mutton generally costs two-and-sixpence;
a shoulder, two shillings; a hand of pork,
eighteenpence; "a cheese"&mdash;they had one every week,
but it is not stated how much it weighed&mdash;varies from
one-and-twopence to one-and-eightpence. Butter is
eight or nine pence a pound; they used about a pound
a week. Sugar is sixpence a pound. They bought their
flour by sixpennyworths, and their coals in small
quantities for eighteenpence each week during the
winter, so that their fires must have been principally
kept going with wood. Once a month the washer-woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">{423}</a></span>
is called in, and sheets are washed; therefore,
the washing was all done at home. Raisins and currants
at twopence a pound, eggs, nutmegs, ginger,
mace, rice, suet, etc., proclaim the pudding. It was
made in fifty different ways, but the ingredients were
always the same, and in this family they evidently had
pudding every day. Cakes, also, they had, and pies,
both fruit pies and meat pies, and open tarts. These
were all sent to the bake-house to be baked at one
penny each, so that the kitchen contained no oven.
Candles were fivepence a pound, but the entries of
candles are so irregular that one suspects the accounts
to be imperfect. Herrings were bought nearly every
week, and sometimes ling&mdash;"a pole of ling." Bacon
was sevenpence a pound. Rice was also sevenpence a
pound. Oranges came in about December; cherries
in their season were twopence a pound; gooseberries,
fourpence, sold, I suppose, by the measure; pease, sixpence
a peck; beans, fourpence a quart; asparagus
("sparragrasse") was in April excessively dear&mdash;we
find them giving six shillings and twopence, a most
extravagant expenditure for a single dish; two weeks
later it has gone down to eighteenpence for two hundred.
But how could so careful a housewife spend six
and twopence on a single dish? A "sallet"&mdash;that is, a
lettuce&mdash;is one penny. Once in six weeks or so we find
mention of "earbs"&mdash;that is, thyme, sage, rosemary,
etc.&mdash;for twopence. "Cowcumbers" are a penny apiece,
and a favorite vegetable. Radishes, carrots, turnips,
French beans are also bought. In the spring cream-cheese
appears. Sweet brier is bought every year,
one knows not for what, and roses by the bushel, evidently
for rose-water. This is the only allusion to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">{424}</a></span>
still-room, which undoubtedly formed part of the
ménage. Nothing is said of preserved fruits, home-made
wines, distilled waters, or pickles, which then
formed a great part of house-keeping. They pickled
everything: walnuts, gherkins, asparagus, peaches,
cauliflowers, plums, nectarines, onions, lemons, barberries,
mushrooms, nasturtium buds, lime-tree buds,
oysters, samphire, elder roots. They distilled rose-buds
and rose-leaves, lavender, walnut-water, and
cherry-water. They always had plague-water handy,
hysterical-water, and other sovereign remedies. They
"jarred" cherries, quinces, hops, apricots, damsons,
and peaches. They made syrups in many pleasing
varieties. They knew how to keep green pease, green
gooseberries, asparagus, and damsons till Christmas.
They made wine out of all the fruits in their season;
the art still survives, though the club-man of the town
turns up his nose at the delicate cowslip, the robust
ginger, and the dainty raspberry&mdash;a dessert wine.
They potted everything, from pigeon to venison.
Nothing is said of these things in the account-books.
But the large quantity of vinegar bought every week
shows the activity of the pickling department. Only
once is there any appearance of spirits. It is when a
bottle of brandy is bought, at one shilling and twopence.
Perhaps that was used to fortify the raspberry
and the currant wines. Very little milk is bought.
Sometimes for many months there is no mention of
milk. This may have been because their own dairy
supplied them. Perhaps, however, milk was only occasionally
used in the house. The food of very young
children, infants after they were weaned, was not then
milk but pap, which I suppose to have been some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">{425}</a></span>
compound of flour and sugar. There is no mention in
the accounts at all of tea, coffee, or chocolate. Tea
was already a fashionable drink, but at this time it
was sixty shillings a pound&mdash;a price which placed it
quite beyond the reach of the ordinary household.
Coffee was much cheaper; at the coffee-houses it was
sold at a penny a cup, but it had not yet got into
private houses.</p>

<p>Turning to other things besides food. Schooling
"for E. J." was twopence a week. His shoes were one
shilling and ninepence the pair. The cobbler who
made them was Goodman Archer; Goody Archer was
his wife. A letter cost twopence or fourpence; everything
bought or ordered was brought by the carrier,
which greatly increased the expense; a lady's gloves
cost two shillings a pair; her silk stockings, ten shillings,
and ordinary stockings, six shillings a pair; her shoes,
three shillings; her mask, one shilling; her pattens for
muddy weather were two shillings a pair; her knitting-needles
cost a penny apiece; her steel bodkin, twopence;
her needles, eightpence the half-hundred; her
pins, ninepence a thousand; her ribbons, threepence a
yard. As for the little things required for the house,
they were far dearer than now, considering especially
the value of money. For instance, a mop cost a shilling;
a pitcher, fivepence; glasses, one shilling and
eightpence each; an earthenware pan, fourpence; a
broom, sixpence; a mustard-pot, one shilling and sixpence;
a padlock, tenpence; a mouse-trap, tenpence;
eleven shillings were given for a pair of candlesticks,
probably of brass. Holland was two shillings a yard;
a "newsbook" cost a penny. On one occasion&mdash;only
once&mdash;it is recorded that the family bought a book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">{426}</a></span>
Only one, and then it was so expensive that they
could never afford to buy another. This is the entry:
"Paid a gentleman for a book, £3 10<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>" What
book, one asks in wonder, could be worth seventy
shillings in the year 1678&mdash;that is, about £15 of
present money&mdash;to a man who was neither a scholar
nor a collector?</p>

<p>The servants were up and took their breakfast at
six in the winter and at five in the summer. The
family breakfasted at eight. They had, for the most
part, cold meat and beer with oat-cake. Pepys tells
us of a breakfast of cold turkey-pie and goose&mdash;imagine
a poor, weak creature of this generation making a
breakfast of turkey-pie and goose, or of goose alone,
with small beer! At another time he had bread and
butter, sweetmeats, and strong drinks. And on another
occasion he sat down to a table spread with
oysters, anchovies, and neats' tongues, with wine "of
all sort."</p>

<p>At two o'clock dinner was served. If it was boiled-beef
day, the broth was served in porringers, bread or
oat-cake being crumbled into it with herbs. When it
was not boiled-beef day, they had fresh meat or poultry
(the latter only seldom), and, in season, what are
called in the accounts "pateridges"&mdash;it really matters
little how a bird is spelled, provided it is well
cooked and ready to be eaten. The invariable rule
of the house was to have two joints a week, mutton,
veal, pork, or poultry. This provided four dinners, or
perhaps five. The other two or three dinners were
consecrated to boiled beef. Calf's head and bacon
was (deservedly) a favorite dish; they did not disdain
tripe; black puddings were regarded with affection;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">{427}</a></span>
a hog's cheek was reckoned a toothsome kickshaw;
anchovies, prawns, and lobsters are also mentioned
with commendation. On most days they had a pudding&mdash;the
good old English pudding, boiled or baked,
with raisins and "currance" in it, flour, eggs, butter,
sugar, nutmeg, mace, ginger, suet, and sometimes
milk&mdash;a famous pudding of which no one was ever
tired.</p>

<p>The menu of a dinner where there was company is
preserved in Pepys. Everything was served at once.
They had marrow-bones, a leg of mutton, three pullets,
and a dozen larks in one dish, a tart, a neat's
tongue, anchovies, and a dish of prawns, and cheese.
This was for thirteen persons.</p>

<p>The dishes were served in pewter, as they are still
for the students in the hall of Lincoln's Inn. The
supper, of which very little is said, was like the breakfast,
but not quite so solid. Cheese played a large
part in the supper, and in summer "a sallet"&mdash;cost,
one penny&mdash;or a dish of "redishes" helped out the
cold meat. After supper a cool tankard of ale&mdash;not
small beer&mdash;stood within the master's reach while he
took his pipe of tobacco. In the winter there was a
posset or a toasted crab in the jug.</p>

<p>One is sorry to part with this interesting family,
but, unfortunately, further information is lacking; I
could give the inventory of the master's linen and
that of his wife, but these details want general interest.
So they disappear, the master, the mistress, Mr.
Arthur, and the baby. Let us hope that they all enjoyed
a long life and prospered exceedingly. After
pondering so long over their account-books, one seems
to know them so well. They have become personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">{428}</a></span>
friends. They sit on the green cloth chairs in the
room with the green carpet and the green curtains
and the fine tapestry. The chairs are high and straight
in the back. Madam has her knitting in her lap.
The master and Mr. Arthur sit on opposite sides of
the fire, their heads adorned with beautiful flowing
perriwigs of brown hair, their own color, which they
have curled every week at an expense of twopence.
They are sipping hot spiced ale and talking of last
Sunday morning's sermon. They are grave and responsible
people, rather fat in the cheeks because they
take so little exercise and so much beer. In the window
stands a row of books. Among them was Jeremy
Taylor's <i>Holy Living and Dying</i>, Herrick's <i>Hesperides</i>,
Baxter's <i>Saints' Rest</i>, Braithwaite's <i>Arcadian
Princess</i>, Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i>, the first edition in
ten books; a Book of Husbandry, a Prophetical Almanack&mdash;that
of Montelion&mdash;and I suppose, if we
only knew it, the book for which they paid the "gentleman"
£3 10<i>s.</i>&mdash;was it a Bible, illustrated? It is only
seventeen years since the commonwealth; there are
Puritans still; their talk chiefly turns on godly matters;
the clamor and the scandal of the Court hardly
so much as reaches their ears. The clouds roll over;
they are gone. Oh, world of change and fleeting
shadows! Whither do they go, the flying shadows,
the ghosts, the groups and pictures of the men and
women that flit before our eyes when we raise the
wizard's wand and conjure up the spirits of the past?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">{429}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">GEORGE THE SECOND</span></h2>


<p>From the accession of the First to the death of
the Fourth George very little change took place
in the outward appearance or the customs of London
and its people. Not that these kings could have had
anything to do with the manners or the changes of
the City. The first two Georges were Germans who
understood not their chief town, and had neither love
nor fear for the citizens, such as possessed the Plantagenets,
the Tudors, and the Stuarts. There was
little change, because the forces that produce change
were working slowly. Ideas, for instance, are always
changing, but the English people are slow to catch
the new ideas. They were born in this country, but
they were developed in France, and they produced
the French Revolution. For this they were suppressed
in England, only to grow and spread more
rapidly underground, and to produce changes of a
more stable kind than the effervescence of the First
Republic.</p>

<p>There was little communication between town and
town or between town and country. The rustic never
left his native village unless he enlisted. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">{430}</a></span>
never returned. The mechanic lived out his life over
his work on the spot where he was born and where he
was brought up. The London shopkeeper never
went farther afield than Hampstead, and generally
found sufficient change of air at Bagnigge Wells or
in Moorfields. If wealth and trade increased, which
they did by leaps and bounds, it was still on the old
lines: the City jealous of its rights, the masters keeping
the wealth for themselves, and the men remaining
in silence and submission.</p>

<p>One important change may, however, be noted.
The City had by this time ceased altogether to attract
the younger sons of the country gentry; the old connection,
therefore, between London and the counties
was severed. The chief reason was that the continual
wars of the century found employment and a career
for all the younger sons in the services, and that the
value of land went up enormously. Trade was no
longer recruited from the better sort, class distinctions
were deepened and more sharply defined even among
the middle class: a barrister looked down upon a
merchant, and would not shake hands with an attorney,
while a simple clergyman would not associate
with a man in business. Sydney Smith, for instance,
refused to stay a night at a country-house because its
owner was a banker and a tradesman. The real extent
of the contempt with which trade was regarded,
and the width of the breach between the court and
the City, was illustrated when the corporation entertained
the Queen on her accession at Guildhall, when
the Lord Mayor and the corporation, the <i>givers of
the feast</i>, were actually set down at a lower table separate
from the Queen their guest! Think of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">{431}</a></span>
other great dinner chronicled above, where the mayor
entertained four kings and played cards with them after
dinner!</p>

<p>In the picture of London just before the present
age we will confine ourselves as much as possible to
the life of the bourgeois. For the court, for the life
of the aristocracy, the statesmen, the poets, the scholars,
the artists&mdash;they are sufficiently written about
elsewhere. Here we will keep as much as we can to
the great mass of the London citizens who know
nothing of court and noble, but are sober, hard-working,
honest folk, their chief care being to pay their
way, avoid bankruptcy, and amass a certain sum of
money before they die; their chief subject of admiration
being the man who leaves behind him a great
fortune made in trade; their chief pleasures being
those of the table.</p>

<p>First, for the extent of the City.</p>

<p>London in 1750 was spreading, but not yet rapidly.
East and west it spread, not north and south. Eastward
the City had thrown out a long arm by the river-side.
St. Katherine's Precinct was crowded; streets,
two or three deep, stretched along the river-bank as
far as Limehouse, but no farther. These were inhabited
by the people who made their living on the river.
Immediately north of these streets stretched a great
expanse of market-gardens and fields. Whitechapel
was already a crowded suburb, filled with working-men.
This was one of the quarters where the London
mob was born and bred, and free from interference
of clergy or rich folk. Clerkenwell, with the
parts about Smithfield, was another district dear to
thieves, pickpockets, and rowdies. Within its boundaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">{432}</a></span>
the City was well and carefully ordered. Unfortunately,
this order did not extend beyond the
walls. Outside there were no companies, no small
parishes, no rich merchants, no charities, schools, or
endowments, and practically it was without churches.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 474px;"><a name="HOUSES_IN_ST_KATHERINE39S_PULLED_DOWN_IN_1827" id="HOUSES_IN_ST_KATHERINE39S_PULLED_DOWN_IN_1827"></a>
<img src="images/page_432.jpg" width="474" height="358" alt="HOUSES IN ST. KATHERINE&#39;S, PULLED DOWN IN 1827" title="" />
<span class="caption">HOUSES IN ST. KATHERINE&#39;S, PULLED DOWN IN 1827</span>
</div>

<p>On the north side, Moorfields still remained an open
space; beyond lay Hoxton Fields, White Conduit
Fields, Lamb's Conduit Fields, and Marylebone Fields.
The suburb of Bloomsbury was beginning. A crowded
suburb had sprung up north of the Strand. Westminster
was a great city by itself. Southwark, now a
borough with half a million people, as great as Liverpool,
occupied then a little strip of marshy land not
half a mile broad at its widest. East and west, to
Lambeth on the one side and to Redriff on the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">{433}</a></span>
was a narrow strip of river-side, dotted with houses
and hamlets.</p>

<p>The walls of the City were never formally pulled
down. They disappeared bit by bit. Houses were
built close to them and upon them: they were covered
up. Excavations constantly bring to light some
of the foundations. When a church-yard was placed
against the wall, as at St. Giles's, Cripplegate, and at
St. Alphege, London Wall, some portions were allowed
to remain. The course of the wall is perfectly
well known, and has often been mapped. It is strange,
however, that the corporation should have been so
careless as to make no attempt at all to preserve some
portions of this most interesting monument.</p>

<p>The gates still stood, and were closed at sunset,
until the year 1760. Then they were all pulled down,
and the materials sold. Temple Bar, which was never
a City gate, properly speaking, remained until the
other day. The gates were, I suppose, an obstruction
to traffic, yet one regrets their disappearance. They
were not old, but they had a character of their own,
and they preserved the memory of ancient sites. I
wish they could have been preserved to this day. A
statue of Queen Elizabeth, which formerly stood on
the west front of Lud Gate, is, I believe, the only part
of a City gate not destroyed. It is now placed on
the south wall of St. Dunstan's, Fleet Street, where
thousands pass by every day, regardless of this monument
of London before the fire!</p>

<p>I have found, in a pamphlet written (1754) to advocate
certain improvements in the City, glimpses of
things too petty for the dignity of history, yet not
without interest to one who wishes to reconstruct the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">{434}</a></span>
life of the time. For instance, the streets were not
cleaned, except in certain thoroughfares; at the back
of the Royal Exchange, for instance, was a scandalous
accumulation of filth suffered to remain, and the posterns
of the City gates were equally neglected and
abused. The rubbish shot into the streets was not
cleared away; think of the streets all discharging the
duty of the dust-bin! Cellar doors and windows were
left open carelessly; stone steps projected from the
houses far across the foot-path. Where pavement had
been laid down it was suffered to become broken and
ruinous, and so left. Houses that had fallen down or
been burned down were left unbuilt, an ugly hole in
the line of the street. Sheds for shops were placed
against the walls of churches, as at St. Antholin's,
Budge Row, and at St. Ethelburga's, where they still
remain, transformed into houses. Sheds for shops
have been built out in the street before the houses in
certain places. Houses rebuilt are pushed forward
into the street. Live bullocks driven through the
streets are a constant danger; mad dogs are another
danger&mdash;why is there no tax on dogs? Beggars and
vagrants swarm in every street. The common people
practise habitually a profaneness of speech which is
shocking. These are some of the things complained
of by my pamphleteer. He next advocates certain
improvements. He would establish a public Mercantile
Library&mdash;we now have it at the Guildhall. He
complains that the City gates have been encroached
upon and defaced&mdash;six years later they were taken
down. He shows us that while within the City itself
there were oil-lamps set up at regular intervals in all
the streets, there were none outside the Freedom. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">{435}</a></span>
that time beyond St. Martin's le Grand, and in the
district of St. Bartholomew's, the streets were left in
darkness absolute. This was shortly afterwards remedied.
He wants stronger and stouter men for the
City watch, and would have some stationed in different
parts of the City in
the daytime. That, too,
was done, after many
years. We must consider
that the old theory was
that the citizens should
in the daytime keep order
for themselves. He
asks why no wheel carriages
are permitted on
the north side of St.
Paul's. He might ask
the same question still,
and the answer would be
that it is a very great happiness to be able to keep
one, if only one, street in London free from carts and
omnibuses.</p>

<span class="caption">LUD GATE</span>
</div>

<p>He then proceeds to propose the erection of equestrian
statues in various parts of the City. This has
now been accomplished, but yet we are not wholly
satisfied. He would put up piazzas, porticos, and
triumphal arches here and there; he would remove
the bars and chains of Holborn, Smithfield, Aldersgate,
Bishopsgate, and Whitechapel, and would put
up stone piers with the City arms upon them. We
have almost forgotten those bars and chains. He proposes
a new stone bridge across the river at the mouth
of Fleet Ditch. Blackfriars Bridge has been erected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">{436}</a></span>
there. It is a most instructive pamphlet, written, it is
evident, by a man much in advance of his age.</p>

<p>The best description of London about this time is
certainly Gay's "Trivia." Witness the following lines
on Thames Street:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O who that rugged street would traverse o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That stretches, O Fleet Ditch, from thy black shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the Tow'r's moated walls? Here steams ascend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, in mixed fumes, the wrinkled nose offend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where chandler's cauldrons boil; where fishy prey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hide the wet stall, long absent from the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where the cleaver chops the heifer's spoil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where huge hogsheads sweat with trainy oil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy breathing nostril hold: but how shall I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pass, where in piles Carnavian cheeses lie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cheese, that the table's closing rites denies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bids me with th' unwilling chaplain, rise?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If you were to ask any person specially interested
in the Church of England&mdash;not necessarily a clergyman
of that Church&mdash;which was the deadest and lowest
and feeblest period in the history of the Anglican
Church, he would, without the least hesitation, reply
that the reign of George the Second covered that
period. This is universally accepted. I think, however,
that one may show, without much trouble, that
this belief is not based upon inquiry into the facts of
the time. The Church of George the Second did not,
it is true, greatly resemble that of this generation: it
had its own customs, and it had its own life. It is
certain that the churches were what is commonly called
"ugly"&mdash;that is to say, they were built by Wren,
or were imitations of his style, and had nothing to do
with Early English, or Decorated, or even Perpendicular.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">{437}</a></span>
Also, it is certain that the congregations sat in
pews, each family by itself; that there were some few
pews of greater dignity than others, where sat my
Lord Mayor, or the aldermen, or the sheriffs, or the
masters of City companies. It is also certain that all
the churches had galleries; that the services were performed
from a "three-decker;" that the sermon was
preached in a black gown, and that the clergyman
called himself a minister, and not a priest. All these
things are abominations to some of us in the latter
half of the nineteenth century. There were also pluralists;
the poor were left very much to themselves,
and the parish was not "worked" according to modern
ideas. There were no mothers' meetings, no day
in the country, no lectures and tea-meetings; no
activity; no "working," in fact, at all. But was it
quite a dead time? Let us see.</p>

<p>There were at that time a hundred and nine parish
churches in London and Westminster. At forty-four
of these there was daily service&mdash;surely this is a recognized
indication of some religious activity&mdash;at one
of these there were three daily services; at all of them&mdash;the
whole hundred and nine&mdash;there were services
every Wednesday and Friday, and on all holy days
and saints' days. There were endowments for occasional
sermons in nearly every church. So much of
the Puritan spirit remained that the sermon was still
considered the most important part of Church service;
in other words, sound doctrine being then held
to be essential to salvation, instruction in doctrine was
considered of far greater importance than prayer or
praise; a fact which quite sufficiently accounts for
the slovenly character of Church services down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">{438}</a></span>
thirty or forty years ago. The singing, observe, might
be deplorable, but the sermon&mdash;the essential&mdash;was
sound.</p>

<p>Sound doctrine. That was the one thing needful.
It trampled on everything else. Of commercial morality,
of the duties and responsibilities of masters
towards servants, of any rights possessed by the producers
either in their produce or in their government,
or in their power to better their position, not one
word was ever said. The same men who would gravely
and earnestly and with fervent prayers discuss the
meaning of a text, would take a share in a slaver
bound for the Guinea Coast and Jamaica, or go out to
watch the flogging of a wretch at the cart-tail, or the
hanging of a poor woman for stealing a loaf of bread,
without a thought that they were doing or witnessing
anything but what was right and laudable. The same
men would cheerfully pay their servants wages just
enough to live upon and make tenfold, twentyfold
profit to themselves, and think they were doing God
service. So far the religious life of the century was
low and feeble. But the science of morals advances;
it has very little indeed to do with sound doctrine,
but a great deal with human brotherhood; could we
look into the middle of the next century we should
perhaps shudder to discover how we ourselves will be
regarded as inhuman sweaters and oppressors of the
poor. Let us, therefore, cease to speak of our forefathers
with contempt. They had their religion; it
differed from ours; we have ours, and our grandchildren's
will differ from that.</p>

<p>There were no Sunday-schools. These came in towards
the end of the century; still there were schools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">{439}</a></span>
in almost every parish in the City. At these schools
the children were instructed in the rudiments of the
Christian faith. Why, the free-schools of the City,
without counting the great grammar-schools of St.
Paul's, Merchant Taylors', Charter House, Christ's
Hospital, the Mercers', St. Olave's, and St. Saviour's,
gave instruction to five thousand boys and half that
number of girls. There was not a poor boy of respectable
parents in the whole City, I believe, who
could not receive a sound education&mdash;quite as good
as he would now get at a Board School, and on Sunday
he had to go to church and was duly catechised.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="DAVENANT39S_SCHOOL" id="DAVENANT39S_SCHOOL"></a>

<span class="caption">DAVENANT&#39;S SCHOOL</span>
</div>

<p>The theory of parish organization in the last century
was very simple, yet it was effective. The parishes
were small&mdash;some of them tiny in their dimensions&mdash;so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">{440}</a></span>
that, although they were densely populated,
the rector or vicar knew every soul that belonged to
his church. The affairs of the people&mdash;the care of
the poor&mdash;were provided for by the companies. The
children were taught at the free-schools or the grammar-schools.
At fourteen a boy was made a prentice,
and entered some livery. Once in a company, his
whole life was assured. He would get regular work;
he would have the wages due; he would marry; his
children would be cared for as he had been. He
would be looked after not by the Church&mdash;that was
not the function of the Church&mdash;but by his company,
in sickness and in age, as well as in time of strength
and work. Every Sunday, Wednesday, Friday, and
holy day there were services, with sermons; but we
need not suppose that the working-man considered it
his duty to flock to the week-day services. On Sunday,
of course, he went, because the whole parish was
expected to be in church. They did attend. Station
and order were preserved within the church as without.
The rich merchants and the masters sat in the
most beautiful pews possible to conceive, richly carved
with blazoned shields and figures in white and gold,
with high backs, above which the tops of the wigs
proudly nodded. These pews were gathered about
the pulpit, which was itself a miracle of carved work,
though perhaps it was only a box stuck onto the
wall. The altar, the walls, the galleries were all adorned
with wood-carvings. Under the galleries and in
the aisles, on plain benches, sat the folk who worked
for wages, the bedesmen and bedeswomen, and the
charity children. The retail people, who kept the
shops, had less eligible pews behind their betters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">{441}</a></span>
They left the church in order, the great people first,
then the lesser, and then the least. No order and
rank&mdash;all to be equal&mdash;in the house of the Lord?
Nonsense! How could that be allowed when He
has ordained that they shall be unequal outside His
house? The notion of equality in the Church is
quite a modern idea. It is not yet accepted, though
here and there it is tolerated. It is, in fact, revolutionary;
it is subversive of rank. Are we to understand
that it is as easy for a pauper to get into the
kingdom of heaven as a prince? We may say so,
but, my friends, no prince will ever be got to believe
it.</p>

<p>An excellent example of a last-century church is to
be seen in Thames Street. It is the Church of All
Hallows the Great. The building is a square room,
with no beauty except that of proportion; it is rich
in wood-carvings; the pulpit, lavishly adorned with
precious work, ought to belong to some great cathedral;
it has got a screen of carved wood right across
the church which is most beautiful. The old arrangement
of the last century is still preserved; the pulpit
is placed against the middle of the wall; the pews of
the merchants are gathered about, while the pews of
the common people are those nearest to the communion
table. Formerly the latter were appropriated
to the watermen's apprentices. These youths,
once the hope of the Thames, sat with their backs
to the table, and have left the record of their presence
in their initials carved with dates on the sloping
book-stand. There they are, "J. F. 1710," "B. R.
1734," with a rude carving of a ship, showing how
they beguiled the tedium of the sermon. The arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">{442}</a></span>
of the pews illustrates the importance in
which the sermon was held. The people, as at Paul's
Cross, gathered about the preacher. The modern impatience
with which the sermon is received is mainly
owing to the fact that we no longer feel so strongly
the importance of sound doctrine; we have come to
think, more or less clearly, that the future of a man
cannot possibly depend upon the question whether he
has at any time expressed assent or consent to certain
doctrines which he is wholly incapable of understanding.
We see around us so many forms of creed that
we have grown careless, or tolerant, or contemptuous,
or charitable concerning doctrine.</p>

<p>There were penalties for absence from service. A
man who stayed away was liable to the censure of the
Church, with a fine of one shilling for every offence.
He was called upon to prove where he had been to
church, because it was not thought possible that anybody
should stay away from service altogether. If a
person harbored in his house one who did not attend
the parish church, he was liable to a fine of £20 a
month; the third part of the fine being given to the
informer. I do not suppose that these laws were ever
rigidly enforced; otherwise the Nonconformists would
have cried out oftener and louder. But their spirit
remained. During the week, the parish, save for the
services, was left to take care of itself. There were
no visits, no concerts, no magic lanterns, no Bible
classes, no missionary meeting&mdash;nothing&mdash;everybody
attended to his own business. The men worked all
day long; the women looked after the house all day
long; in the evenings the taverns were crowded; there
were clubs of all kinds; everybody took his tobacco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">{443}</a></span>
and his glass at a tavern or a club, and no harm was
thought of it.</p>

<p>For the old people there were almshouses, and there
was the bounty of the companies. And since there
must be always poor people among us, there were
doles in every parish. Special cases were provided
for as they arose by the merchants themselves. Finally,
if one was sick or dying, the clergyman went to
read the office appointed for the sick; and when one
died, he read the office appointed for the dead.</p>

<p>All this is simple and intelligible. The Church provided
instruction in doctrine for old and young, forms
of prayer, consolation in sickness, baptism, communion,
and burial for all; some churches had charitable endowments;
the rest was left to the parishioners themselves.
This is not quite the modern idea of the
parish, but it seems to have worked as well as our own
practice. Their clergyman was a divine, and nothing
more; ours undertakes the care of the poor first of
all; he is the administrator of charity; he is, next, the
director of schools, the organizer of amusements, the
leader of athletics, the trainer of the choir, the president
of musical societies, the founder of working-lad's
institutes; he also reads the service at church, and he
preaches a short sermon every Sunday; but the latter
functions are not much regarded by his people. Their
clergyman was a divine; he was therefore a scholar.
Therein lies the whole difference. We have no divines
now, and very few scholars among the parish clergy, or
even among the bishops. Here and there one or two
divines are found upon the Episcopal bench, and one or
two at Oxford and Cambridge; in the parish churches,
none. We do not ask for divines, or even for preachers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">{444}</a></span>
we want organizers, administrators, athletes, and
singers. And the only reason for calling the time of
George the Second a dead time for the Church seems
to be that its clergy were not like our own.</p>

<p>Let us walk abroad and view the streets. They are
changed, indeed, since Stow led us from St. Andrew's
Undershaft to St. Paul's. The old gabled houses are
all gone, except in the narrow limits of that part spared
by the fire; in their places are tall houses with large
sash windows and flat façade. Within, they are wainscoted,
the fashion of tapestry having completely gone
out. Foot-passengers are protected by rows of posts
at intervals of four or five feet. Flat paving-stones are
not in general use, and those that have been laid down
are small and insecure. The shops are small, and
there is little pretence at displaying the goods; they
have, however, all got windows
in front. A single candle, or
two at the most, illuminate the
wares in the evening or the
short afternoons of winter. A
sign hangs out over every door.
The drawing of St. Dunstan's
in the West shows that part
of Fleet Street before the paving-stones
were laid down. The
only pavement both for the
road and the footway consisted
of large, round pebbles,
over which the rolling of the
vehicles made the most dreadful noise. In the year
1762, however, an improvement was introduced in
Westminster, followed by the City of London in 1766.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">{445}</a></span>
The roads were paved with squares of Scotch granite
laid in gravel; the posts were removed; a curb was
laid down; gutters provided, and the footway paved
with flat stones. About the same time the corporation
took down the overhanging signs, removed the
City gates, covered over Fleet Ditch, and broadened
numerous narrow passages. The drawing here reproduced
of the Monument and the beginning of London
Bridge dates between 1757 and 1766; for the houses
are already down in the bridge&mdash;this was done in 1757,
and the posts and signs are not yet removed from the
street. The view gives an excellent idea of a London
street of that time. The posts were by no means all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">{446}</a></span>
removed. The drawing of Temple Bar from Butcher
Row, taken as late as 1796, in which they are still
standing, shows this. It also shows the kind of houses
in the lower streets. Butcher Row, though it stood
in the Strand at the back of St. Clement's Church, a
highly respectable quarter, was one of the most disreputable
places in the whole of London&mdash;given over
to crimps, flash lodging-houses, and people of the
baser sort.</p>

<p>There are certain dangers and inconveniences in
walking along the streets: the finest dress may be
ruined by the carelessness of a dustman or a chimney-sweep;
the custom of exposing meat on open bulkheads
leads to many an irreparable stain of grease.
Bullies push the peaceful passenger into the gutter&mdash;it
is a great time for street swagger; barbers blow the
flour into wigs at open doorways, causing violent
wrath among those outside; mad bulls career up and
down the streets; men quarrel, make a ring, and fight
it out before the traffic can go on; pickpockets are
both numerous and dexterous; footpads abound in the
open squares of Lincoln's Inn, Bloomsbury, and Portman;
highwaymen swarm on all the roads; men-servants
are insolent and rascally; the noise in the
leading streets is deafening; in a shower the way
becomes impassable from the rain-spouts on the roof,
which discharge their contents upon the streets below.</p>

<p>We who now object to the noise of a barrel-organ
in the street, or a cry of milk, or a distant German
band, would be driven mad by a single day of George
the Second's London streets. Hogarth has touched
the subject, but only touched it. No one could do
more in a picture than indicate the mere fringe of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">{447}</a></span>
this vast subject. Even on the printed page we can
do little more than the painter. For instance, here
were some of the more common and every-day and
all-day-long noises. Many of the shopkeepers still
kept up the custom of having a prentice outside
bawling an invitation to buy&mdash;buy&mdash;buy. To this
day, butchers at Clare Market cry out at the stalls,
all day long, "Rally up, ladies! Rally up! Buy!
Buy! Buy!" In the streets of private houses there
passed a never-ending procession of those who bawled
things for sale. Here were a few of the things they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">{448}</a></span>
bawled&mdash;I am conscious that it is a very imperfect
list. There were those who offered to do things&mdash;mend
chairs, grind knives, solder pots and pans, buy
rags or kitchen stuff, rabbit skins, hair, or rusty swords,
exchange old clothes or wigs, mend old china, cut
wires&mdash;this excruciating, rasping operation was apparently
done in the open&mdash;or cooper casks. There
were, next, the multitude of those who carried wares
to sell&mdash;as things to eat and drink&mdash;saloop, barley
broth, rice, milk, furmity, Shrewsbury cakes, eggs,
lily-white vinegar, hot peascods, rabbits, birds, pullets,
gingerbread, oysters, honey, cherry ripe, Chaney
oranges, hot codlins, pippins, fruit of all kinds, fish
taffity tarts, fresh-water, tripe, tansy, greens, mustard,
salt, gray pease, water-cresses, shrimps, rosemary, lavender,
milk, elder-buds; or things of domestic use&mdash;lace,
ribbons, almanacs, ink, small coal, sealing-wax,
wood to cleave, earthen-ware, spigots, combs, buckles,
leghorns, pewter pots, brooms in exchange for old
shoes, things of horn, Holland socks, woollen socks
and wrappers, brimstone matches, flint and steel, shoelaces,
scissors and tools, straps, and the thousand-and-one
things which are now sold in shops. The bearward
came along with his animal and his dogs and his
drum, the sweep shouted from the house-top, the ballad-singer
bawled in the road, the tumbler and the
dancing-girl set up their pitch with pipe and drum.
Nobody minded how much noise was made. In the
smaller streets the good-wives sat with open doors,
running in and out, gossiping over their work; they
liked the noise, they liked this perambulating market&mdash;it
made the street lively, it brought the neighbors out
to look, and it pleased the baby. Then the wagons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">{449}</a></span>
went ponderously grinding over the round stones of
the road, the carts rumbled, the brewers' sledges
growled, the chariot rattled, the drivers quarrelled,
cursed, and fought. A great American, now, alas!
gone from us, spoke of the continual murmur of London
as of Niagara afar off. A hundred years ago he
would have spoken of the continual roar.</p>

<p>At this time the wealth and trade of London had
reached a point which surprised and even terrified
those who considered the present compared with the
past and looked forward to the future. "On a general
view," writes Northouck in 1772, "of our national
circumstances it is but too probable that the height
of our prosperity is now producing our ruin." He
hears the cry of the discontented; it means, he thinks,
ruin. Well, there were to be mighty changes, and
still more mighty changes of which he suspects nothing.
Yet not ruin. For, whatever happens, the energy
and the spirit of the people will remain. Besides,
Northouck and those of his time did not understand
that the world is always growing wider.</p>

<p>The great merchants of the City still lived within
the old boundaries: they had their country-houses,
but they spent most of their time in town, where their
houses were stately and commodious, but no longer
palaces like those of their predecessors. Two or three
of them remain, but they are rapidly disappearing.
One of these, destroyed about six years ago, illustrated
the house of a merchant at a time when his offices
and his residence were one. The rooms for his clerks
were on the ground floor; the merchant's private
room looked out upon a garden at the back. In the
basement was his strong-room, constructed of stone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">{450}</a></span>
in a deep recess. On the first floor were the living-rooms.
The garden was not large, but it contained a
stone terrace fine enough for a garden of much larger
dimensions, a mulberry-tree, and a vine.</p>

<p>There were no palaces left in the City; no noblemen
lived there any longer. The Lord Mayor's Mansion,
built in 1750, was the only palace unless we
count Guildhall, the Royal Exchange, Gresham College,
and the Halls of the Companies. But in every
street except those given up entirely to trade, such as
Cheapside, stood the substantial house of the City
Fathers.</p>

<p>Never before had the City been so wealthy. Despite
the continual wars of the eighteenth century,
nothing could check the prosperity of the country.
French privateers scoured the ocean in chase of our
merchantmen; every East Indiaman had to run the
gantlet all the way from Madeira to Plymouth; the
supremacy of the sea was obstinately disputed by
France; yet more ships escaped than were taken.
Our Indiamen fought the privateer and sank him;
our fleets retaliated; our frigates protected the merchantmen,
and when, as happened sometimes, we had
the pleasure of fighting Spain as well as France, the
balance of captures was greatly in our favor. "Sir,"
said Lord Nelson to the King, when Spain declared
war against us, "this makes all the difference. It
promised to be a poor war; it will now be a rich
war."</p>

<p>This was written by the Water Poet, John Taylor, a
little later. The river was the most convenient and
the most rapid road from one end of London to the
other, at a time when the roads were miry and full of
holes, and when there were no coaches. And long
after coaches became numerous, the watermen continued
to flourish. There were only two bridges over
the river; many places of amusement&mdash;the Paris Gardens,
Cupid Gardens, St. George's Fields, and Vauxhall&mdash;lay
on the south side: it was pleasant and quiet
on the water, save for the quarrels and the cursing of
the watermen. The air was fresh: the view of the
City was noble: the river was covered with barges and
pleasure-boats furnished with banners and streamers
of silk; flocks of swans swimming about&mdash;little wonder
if the citizens continued to prefer the river to
their muddy lanes and noisy streets. Even in the
last century, too, the watermen had not ceased to
sing as they rowed. They still sang&mdash;with a "Heave
and hoe, rumbelow"&mdash;their old ballad of "Row the
boat, Norman, to thy leman," made, it was said, on
John Norman, first of the mayors who was rowed to
Westminster by water instead of riding, as had been
the previous custom.</p>

<p>Those who have read Professor Seeley's book on the
Extension of Britain know how our conquests, our
power, and our trade increased during that long struggle
with France. We had losses; we made an enemy
beyond the Atlantic who should have been our firmest
friend and ally; we were hampered with continental
possessions; we were continually suffering enormous
drains of money and of men; we were throwing
away our lusty youth by hundreds of thousands; yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">{452}</a></span>
we continued to grow stronger and richer every year.
The wars advanced trade; the wars pushed forward
our territories; our increased trade paid for the wars;
the wars provided occupation for younger sons.</p>

<p>By this time, too, the companies were at their richest;
their charities were at their fullest; their banquets
and functions were most lavish and splendid.</p>

<p>Take the rich Company of Haberdashers alone for
its benefactions. This company maintained two free-schools
in London and three in the country; two
almshouses in London and two in the country; it
presented to six benefices in the country; it provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">{453}</a></span>
three lectureships in city churches and one in the University
of Cambridge; it gave five exhibitions to Cambridge,
and it provided pensions for forty-eight poor
men and women. In these charities the company
disbursed about £3400 a year. At the present day it
gives away a great deal more owing to the increased
value of its property, but as London is so much
larger the effect is not so great in proportion. This
list of charities, again, does not include the execution
of certain testamentary and private charities, as broadcloth
to poor widows, gifts to prisoners for debt, payments
for ringing the church-bell, weekly doles of
bread, and so forth. The Haberdashers' Company
was one of the twelve great companies, all wealthy.
If each of these gave away yearly the sum of £2000
only, we have £24,000 a year. There were, besides,
all the smaller companies, and not one without some
funds for charity, education, or pensions. A boy born
in the City might be educated by his father's company,
apprenticed to the company, taught his trade
by the company, found in work by the company,
feasted once a year by the company, pensioned by
the company, buried by the company, and his children
looked after by the company. If he fell into
debt, and so arrived at Ludgate Hill Prison, the bounty
of the company followed him there. And even if
he disgraced himself and was lodged in Newgate, the
company augmented the daily ration of bread with
something more substantial. In all, there were (and
are) eighty-four City companies, representing every
trade except those which are of modern origin. Among
these are not counted such companies as the Whitawers,
the Fustarers, and the Megusers, long since dissolved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">{454}</a></span>
But the Pewterers, the Bowyers, the Fletchers,
the Long Bowstring Makers, the Patten Makers,
and the Loriners have survived the trades which they
were founded to maintain. Some of them have no
hall and very small endowments. One, the Card
Makers, presents each member of the company with
a pack of playing-cards every year, and with this single
act expends, I believe, all the endowment which
it possesses.</p>

<p>By poetic license, quite pardonable when assumed
by Austin Dobson or by Praed, we speak of the leisure
of the eighteenth century. Where is it&mdash;this leisure?
I can find it nowhere. In London City the sober merchant
who walks so gravely on 'Change is an eager,
venturesome trader, pushing out his cargoes into every
quarter of the globe, as full of enterprise as an Elizabethan,
following the flag wherever that leads, and
driving the flag before him. He belongs to a battling,
turbulent time. His blood is full of fight. He makes
enormous profits; sometimes he makes enormous
losses; then he breaks; he goes under; he never lifts
up his head again; he is submerged&mdash;he and his, for
the City has plenty of benevolence, but little pity.
We are all pushing, struggling, fighting to get ahead.
We cannot stop to lift up one that has fallen and is
trampled under foot. In the City there stands behind
us a Fury armed with a knotted scourge. Let us
work, my brothers, let us never cease to work, for this
is the terrible pitiless demon called Bankruptcy. If
there is no leisure or quiet among the sober citizens,
where shall we look for it? In the country? We are
not here concerned with the country, but I have looked
for it there and I cannot find it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">{455}</a></span></p>

<p>It was the dream of every tradesman not only to
escape this fiend, but in fulness of time to retire from
his shop and to have his own country-house; or, if
that could not be compassed, to have a box three or
four miles from town&mdash;at Stockwell, Clapham, Hoxton,
or Bow, or Islington&mdash;whither he might drive on
Saturday or other days, in a four-wheeled chaise. He
loved to add a bow-window to the front, at which he
would sit and watch the people pass, his wine before
him, for the admiration and envy of all who beheld.
The garden at the back, thirty feet long by twenty
broad, he laid out with great elegance. There was a
gravel-walk at each end, a pasteboard grenadier set
up in one walk, and a sundial in the other. In the
middle there was a basin with two artificial swans,
over which he moralized: "Sir, I bought those fowls
seven years ago. They were then as white as could
be made. Now they are black. Let us learn that the
strongest things decay, and consider the flight of time."
He put weathercocks on his house-top, and when they
pointed different ways he reflected that there is no
station so exalted as to be free from the inconsistencies
and wants of life.</p>

<p>His wife, of course, was a notable house-keeper. It
is recorded of her that she would never employ a man
unless he could whistle. So that when he was sent to
draw beer, or to bottle wine, or to pick cherries, or to
gather strawberries, by whistling all the time he proved
that his mouth was empty, because you cannot whistle
with anything in your mouth. She made her husband
take off his shoes before going up-stairs; she lamented
the gigantic appetites of the journeymen whom they
had to keep "peck and perch" all the year round;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">{456}</a></span>
she loved a pink sash and a pink ribbon, and when
she went abroad she was genteelly "fetched" by an
apprentice or one of the journeymen with candle and
lantern.</p>

<p>The amusements and sights of London were the
Tower, the Monument, St. Paul's and Westminster
Abbey, the British Museum (after the year 1754, when
it was first opened), the Royal Exchange, the Bank of
England, Guildhall, the East India House, the Custom-house,
the Excise Office, the Navy Office, the bridges,
the Horse Guards, the squares, the Inns of Court, St.
James's Palace, the two theatres of Drury Lane and
Covent Garden, the Opera-house, Ranelagh, Sadler's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">{457}</a></span>
Wells, Vauxhall, Astley's, the Park, the tea-gardens,
Don Saltero's, Chelsea, the trials at the Old Bailey, the
hangings at Newgate, the Temple Gardens, the parade
of the Judges to Westminster Hall, the charity children
at St. Paul's, Greenwich Fair, the reviews of the
troops, the House of Lords when the King is present
and the peers are robed, Smithfield, Billingsgate, Woolwich,
Chelsea Hospital, Greenwich Hospital, and the
suburbs. With these attractions a stranger could get
along for a few days without much fear of ennui.</p>

<p>The London fairs&mdash;Bartholomew, Greenwich, Southwark,
May Fair&mdash;no longer, of course, pretended to have
anything to do with trade. They were simply occasions
for holiday-making and indulgence in undisguised
license and profligacy. They had bull and bear baiting,
cock-fighting, prize-fighting, cudgel-playing&mdash;these
of course. They also had their theatres and their
shows and their jugglers. They had races of women,
fights of women, and dancing of girls for a prize. They
continued the old morris-dance of five men, Maid
Marian and Tom Fool, the last with a fox-brush in his
hat, and bells on his legs and on his coat-tails. They
were fond of rope-dancing&mdash;in a word, the fairs drew
together all the rascality of the town and the country
around. May Fair was stopped in the year 1708, but
was revived some years afterwards. Southwark Fair,
which was opened by the Lord Mayor and sheriffs
riding over the bridge through the borough, was not
suppressed till 1763. The only good thing it did was
to collect money for the poor prisoners of Marshalsea
Prison. Bartholomew and Greenwich Fair continued
till thirty or forty years ago.</p>

<p>The picturesqueness of the time is greatly due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">{458}</a></span>
the dress. We all know how effective on the stage or
at a fancy ball is the dress of the year 1750. Never
had gallant youth a better chance of displaying his
manly charms. The flowered waistcoat tight to the
figure, the white satin coat, the gold-laced hat, the
ruffles and dainty necktie, the sword and the sword-sash,
the powdered wig, the shaven face, the silk stockings
and gold-buckled shoes&mdash;with what an air the
young coxcomb advances, and with what a grace he
handles his clouded cane and proffers his snuffbox!
Nothing like it remains in this century of ours. And
the ladies matched the men in splendor of dress, until
the "swing swang" of the extravagant hoop spoiled
all. Here comes one, on her way to church, where
she will distract the men from their prayers with her
beauty, and the women with her dress. She has a
flowered silk body and cream-colored skirts trimmed
with lace; she has light blue shoulder-knots; she wears
an amber necklace, brown Swedish gloves, and a silver
bracelet; she has a flowered silk belt of green and
gray and yellow, with a bow at the side, and a brown
straw-hat with flowers of green and yellow. "Sir,"
says one who watches her with admiration, "she is all
apple blossom."</p>

<p>The white satin coat is not often seen east of Temple
Bar. See the sober citizen approaching: he is
dressed in brown stockings; he has laced ruffles and
a shirt of snowy whiteness; his shoes have silver
buckles; his wig is dark grizzle, full-bottomed; he carries
his hat under his left arm, and a gold-headed stick
in his right hand. He is accosted by a wreck&mdash;there
are always some of these about London streets&mdash;who
has struck upon the rock of bankruptcy and gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">{459}</a></span>
down. He, too, is dressed in brown, but where are the
ruffles? Where is the shirt? The waistcoat, buttoned
high, shows no shirt; his stockings are of black worsted,
darned and in holes; his shoes are slipshod, without
buckles. Alas! poor gentleman! And his wig is an
old grizzle, uncombed, undressed, dirty, which has been
used for rubbing shoes by a shoeblack. On the other
side of the street walks one, followed by a prentice
carrying a bundle. It is a mercer of Cheapside, taking
some stuff to a lady. He wears black cloth, not brown;
he has a white tye-wig, white silk stockings, muslin
ruffles, and japanned pumps. Here comes a mechanic:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">{460}</a></span>
he wears a warm waistcoat with long sleeves, gray
worsted stockings, stout shoes, a three-cornered hat,
and an apron. All working-men wear an apron; it is
a mark of their condition. They are no more ashamed
of their apron than your scarlet-coated captain is
ashamed of his uniform.</p>

<p>Let us note the whiteness of the shirts and ruffles:
a merchant will change his shirt three times a day; it
is a custom of the City thus to present snow-white
linen. The clerks, we see, wear wigs like their masters,
but they are smaller. The varieties of wigs are endless.
Those that decorate the heads of the clerks are
not the full-bottomed wig, to assume which would be
presumptuous in one in service. Most of the mechanics
wear their hair tied behind; the rustics, sailors,
stevedores, watermen, and river-side men generally wear
it long, loose, and unkempt. There is a great trade in
second-hand wigs. In Rosemary Lane there is a wig
lottery. You pay sixpence, and you dip in a cask for
an old wig. It may turn out quite a presentable thing,
and it may be worthless. Here is a company of sailors
rolling along armed with clubs. They are bound
to Ratcliffe, where, this evening, when the men are all
drinking in the taverns, there will be a press. Their
hats are three-cornered, they wear blue jackets, blue
shirts, and blue petticoats. Their hair hangs about
their ears. Beside them marches the lieutenant in the

<p>Let us consider the private life of the people day
by day. For this purpose we must not go to the essayists
or the dramas. The novels of the time afford
some help; books corresponding to our directories,
almanacs, old account-books, are the real guides to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">{461}</a></span>
reconstruction of life as it was about the year 1750.
From such books as these the following notes are
derived.</p>

<p>The most expensive parts of the town were the
streets round St. Paul's Church-yard, Cheapside, and
the Royal Exchange. Charing Cross, Covent Garden,
and St. James's lie outside our limits. Here the
rent of a moderate house was from a hundred to a
hundred and fifty guineas a year. In less central
places the rents were not more than half as much.
There were six or seven fire insurance offices. The
premium for insurance on houses and goods not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">{462}</a></span>
called hazardous was generally two shillings per cent.
on any sum under £1000, half a crown on all sums
between £1000 and £2000, and three and sixpence
on all sums over £3000, so that a man insuring his
house and furniture for £2500 would pay an annual
premium of £4 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The taxes of a house amounted to about half the
rent. There was the land-tax of four shillings in the
pound; the house-tax of sixpence to a shilling in the
pound; the poor-rate, varying from one shilling to six
shillings in the pound; the window-tax, which made
you pay first three shillings for your house, and then,
with certain exceptions, twopence extra for every window,
so that a house of fourteen windows paid four
and sixpence. In the year 1784 this tax was increased
in order to take the duty off tea. The
church-wardens' rate for repairing the church; the
paving-rate, of one and sixpence in the pound; the
watch; the Easter offerings, which had become optional;
the water-rate, varying from twenty-four shillings
to thirty shillings a year.</p>

<p>The common practice of bakers and milkmen was
to keep a tally on the door-post with chalk. One advantage
of this method was that a mark might be
added when the maid was not looking. The price of
meat was about a third of the present prices; beef being
fourpence a pound, mutton fourpence halfpenny,
and veal sixpence. Chicken were commonly sold at
two and sixpence the pair; eggs were sometimes
three and sometimes eight for fourpence, according to
the time of year. Coals seem to have cost about
forty shillings a ton; but this is uncertain. Candles
were eight and fourpence a dozen for "dips," and nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">{463}</a></span>
and fourpence a dozen for "moulds;" wax-candles
were two and tenpence a pound. For out-door lamps
train-oil was used, and for in-doors spermaceti-oil.
For the daily dressing of the hair, hair-dressers were
engaged at seven shillings to a guinea a month. Servants
were hired at register offices, but they were often
of very bad character, with forged papers. The wages
given were: to women as cooks, £12 a year; lady's-maids,
£12 to £20; house-maids from £7 to £9; footmen,
£14 and a livery. Servants found their own tea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">{464}</a></span>
and sugar, if they wanted any. Board wages were
ten and sixpence a week to an upper servant; seven
shillings to an under servant. Every householder was
liable to serve as church-warden, overseer for the poor,
constable&mdash;but he could serve by deputy&mdash;and juryman.
Peers, clergymen, lawyers, members of Parliament,
physicians, and surgeons were exempted.</p>

<p>The principle of life assurance was already well established,
but not yet in general use. There seem to
have been no more than four companies for life assurance.
The Post-office rates varied with the distance.
A letter from London to any place not exceeding
one stage cost twopence; under two stages,
threepence; under eight miles, fourpence; under 150
miles, fivepence; above 150 miles, to any place in
England, sixpence; to Scotland, sevenpence; to Ireland,
sixpence; to America and the West Indies, a
shilling; to any part of Europe, a shilling to eighteenpence.
There was also a penny post, first set up in
London by a private person. This had five principal
offices. Letters or packets not exceeding four ounces
in weight were carried about the City for one penny,
and delivered in the suburbs for a penny more. There
were no bank-notes of less than £20 before the year
1759; but when the smaller notes were issued, and
came into general use, people very soon found out the
plan of cutting them in two for safety in transmission
by post.</p>

<p>Mail-coaches started every night at eight o'clock
with a guard. They were timed for seven miles an
hour, and the fare for passengers was fourpence a mile.
A passenger to Bristol, for example, who now pays
twenty shillings first-class fare and does the journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">{465}</a></span>
in two hours and a half, then paid thirty-three and
fourpence, and took fourteen hours and a quarter. A
great many of the mails started from the Swan with
Two Necks, a great hostelry and receiving-place in
Lad Lane. The place is now swept away with Lad
Lane itself. It stood in the part of Gresham Street
which runs between Wood Street and Milk Street.</p>

<p>The stage-coaches from different parts of London
were innumerable, as were also the stage-wagons and
the hoys. The coaches charged the passengers threepence
a mile. Hackney-coaches ran for shilling and
eighteenpenny fares. There were hackney-chairs. In
the City there were regular porters for carrying parcels
and letters.</p>

<p>There were nine morning papers, of which the
<i>Morning Post</i> still survives. They were all published
at threepence. There were eight evening papers,
which came out three times a week. And there were
three or four weekly papers, intended chiefly for the
country.</p>

<p>The stamps which had to be bought with anything
were a grievous burden. A pair of gloves worth tenpence&mdash;stamp
of one penny; worth one and fourpence&mdash;stamp
of twopence; above one and fourpence&mdash;stamp
of fourpence. Penalty for selling without a
stamp, £5. Hats were taxed in like manner. Inventories
and catalogues were stamped; an apprentice's
indentures were stamped; every newspaper paid a
stamp of three halfpence. In the year 1753 there
were seven millions and a half of stamps issued to the
journals.</p>

<p>We have seen what it cost a respectable householder
to pay his way in the time of Charles the Second.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">{466}</a></span>
The following shows the cost of living a hundred
years later. The house is supposed to consist of
husband and wife, four children, and two maids:</p>

<p>Food, coals, candles, small beer (of which 12 gallons
are allowed&mdash;that is, 48 quarts, or an average of one
quart a day per head), soap, starch, and all kinds of
odds and ends are reckoned at £3 12<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> a week, or
£189 18<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a year; clothes, including hair-dressing,
£64; pocket expenses, £15 12<i>s.</i>; occasional illness,
£11; schooling, £8; wages, £14 10<i>s.</i>; rent and taxes,
£66; entertainments, wine, etc., £30 19<i>s.</i>: making a
total of £400 a year.</p>

<p>If we take the same family with the same scale of
living at the present day, we shall arrive at the difference
in the cost of things:</p>

<p>A comparison of the figures shows a very considerable
raising of the standard as regards comfort and
even necessaries. It is true that the modern figures
have been taken from the accounts of a family which
spends every year from £1200 to £1400.</p>

<p>It may be remarked in these figures that schooling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">{467}</a></span>
is extremely cheap, viz., £8 per four children, or ten
shillings a quarter for each child. Therefore for a
school-master to get an income of £250 a year, out
of which he would have to maintain assistants, he
must have 125 scholars. The "pocket expenses" include
letters, and all for six shillings a week, which is
indeed moderate. Entertainments, wine, etc., are all
lumped together, showing that wine must be considered
a very rare indulgence, and that small beer is the
daily beverage. Tea is set down at two shillings a
week. In the year 1728 tea was thirteen shillings a
pound, but by 1760 it had gone down to about six
shillings a pound, so that a third of a pound was allowed
every week. This shows a careful measurement
of the spoonful. Of course there was not as
yet any tea allowed to the servants. Coals are estimated
at £14 a year&mdash;two fires in winter, one in summer.
Repairs to furniture, table-linen, sheets, etc., are
set down at two shillings a week, or five guineas a
year. Happy the household which can now manage
this item at six times that amount.</p>

<p>It might be thought that by the middle of the last
century the beverage of tea was universally taken in
this country. This was by no means the case. The
quantity of tea imported about this time amounted to
no more than three-quarters of a pound per annum
for every person in the three kingdoms, whereas it is
now no less than thirty-five pounds for every head.
It was, and had been for fifty years, a fashionable
drink, and it had now become greatly in use&mdash;or, at
all events, greatly desired&mdash;by women of all kinds.
The men drank little of it; men in the country and
working-men not at all. Its use was not so far general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">{468}</a></span>
as to stop the discussion which still continued as
to its virtues. In the year 1749 it was ten shillings a
pound. In 1758 a pamphlet was written by an anonymous
writer on the good and bad effects of drinking
tea. We learn from this that the author is alarmed
at the spreading of the custom of tea-drinking, especially
by "Persons of an inferior rank and mean Abilities."
"It may not," he says, "be altogether above
the reach of the better Sort of Tradesmen's Wives
and Country Dames. But nowadays Persons of the
Lowest Class vainly imitate their Betters by striving
to be in the fashion, and prevalent Custom hath introduced
it into every Cottage, and every Gammer must
have her tea twice a day." The latter statement is
rank exaggeration, as the imports show.</p>

<p>Especially the author finds fault with afternoon tea.
"It is very hurtful," he says, "to those who work hard
and live low; when taken in company with gossips a
dram too often follows; then comes scandal, with falsehoods,
perversions, and backbitings: it is an expense
which very few can afford; it is a waste of time which
ought to be spent in spinning, knitting, making clothes
for the children. Oh, I here with confusion stop, and
know not how sufficiently to bewail my grief to you,
delightful fair! who, by prevalent custom, are led into
one of the worst of habits, rendering you lost to yourselves,
and unfit for the comforts you were first designed.
Be careful; be wise; refuse the bait; fly from
a temptation productive of so many ills. You charming
guiltless young ones, who innocently at home partake
of this genteel regale, avoid the public meetings of
low crafty gossips, who will use persuasions for you to
drink tea with them and some others of their own stamp."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">{469}</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;"><a name="A_DISH_OF_TEA" id="A_DISH_OF_TEA"></a>
<img src="images/page_469.jpg" width="430" height="503" alt="A DISH OF TEA" title="" />
<span class="caption">A DISH OF TEA</span>
</div>

<p>Another bad consequence of afternoon tea is that it
induces the little tradesmen's wives, after selling something,
to offer their customer tea, and after that a dram,
and so vanish all the profits.</p>

<p>But the writer objects altogether to tea. He cannot
find that it possesses any merits. The hot-water,
the cream, and the sugar, he says, are responsible for
all the good effects of tea-drinking. The tea itself is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">{470}</a></span>
responsible for all the bad effects. He enumerates the
opinions advanced by physicians. The learned Dr.
Pauli, physician to the King of Denmark, shows that
the virtues ascribed to it are local, and do not cross
the seas into Europe. Men over forty, he thinks,
should never use it, because it is a desiccative; the
herb betony should be taken by them, because it has
all the virtues and none of the vices of tea. Schroder
and Quincey believed it good for every complaint; the
learned Pechlin held that it is good for scorbutic cases,
but thought that veronica and Paul's betony are just
as good. Dr. Hunt enumerates many diseases for
which its occasional use is good. Finally, the writer
of the pamphlet concludes that tea will rapidly become
cheaper; that it will then go out of fashion; and
that it will be replaced by our own sage, which, he
says, makes a much more wholesome drink, with hot-water,
cream, and sugar.</p>

<p>But a far greater person than this anonymous writer
set his face and the whole force of his authority and
example against the drinking of tea. This was no
other than John Wesley, who, in the year 1748, issued
a "Letter to a Friend, concerning Tea." The following
extracts give the practical part of the letter, omitting
the very strange argument against tea-drinking
based upon Scripture:</p>

<blockquote><p>Twenty-nine years ago, when I had spent a few months at
<i>Oxford</i>, having, as I apprehended, an exceeding good Constitution,
and being otherwise in Health, I was a little surprised
at some Symptoms of a Paralytick Disorder. I could not imagine
what should occasion that shaking of my Hand; till I
observed it was always worst after Breakfast, and that if I intermitted
drinking Tea for two or three Days, it did not shake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">{471}</a></span>
at all. Upon Inquiry, I found Tea had the same effect upon
others also of my Acquaintance; and therefore saw, that this
was one of its natural Effects (as several Physicians have often
remarked), especially when it is largely and frequently drank;
and most of all on Persons of weak Nerves. Upon this I lessened
the Quantity, drank it weaker, and added more Milk and
Sugar. But still, for above six and twenty Years, I was more
or less subject to the same Disorder.</p>

<p><i>July</i> was two Years, I began to observe, that abundance of
the People in <i>London</i>, with whom I conversed, laboured under
the same, and many other Paralytick Disorders, and that in a
much higher Degree; insomuch that some of their Nerves were
quite unstrung; their bodily Strength was quite decay'd, and
they could not go through their daily Labour. I inquired,
'Are you not an hard Drinker?' And was answered by one
and another, 'No, indeed, Sir, not I! I drink scarce any Thing
but a little Tea, Morning and Night.' I immediately remembered
my own Case; and after weighing the matter thoroughly,
easily gathered from many concurring Circumstances, that it
was the same Case with them.</p>

<p>I considered, 'What an Advantage would it be, to these
poor enfeebled People, if they would leave off what so manifestly
impairs their Health, and thereby hurts their Business
also?&mdash;Is there Nothing equally cheap which they could use?
Yes, surely: And cheaper too. If they used <i>English</i> Herbs in
its stead (which would cost either Nothing, or what is next to
Nothing), with the same Bread, Butter, and Milk, they would
save just the Price of the Tea. And hereby they might not
only lessen their Pain, but in some Degree their Poverty too....'</p>

<p>Immediately it struck into my Mind, 'But Example must
go before Precept. Therefore I must not plead an Exemption
for myself, from a daily Practice of twenty-seven Years. I
must begin.' I did so. I left it off myself in <i>August</i>, 1746.
And I have now had sufficient Time to try the Effects, which
have fully answered my Expectation: My Paralytick Complaints
are all gone: My Hand is as steady as it was at Fifteen:
Although I must expect that, or other Weaknesses, soon: as
I decline into the Vale of Years. And so considerable a Difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">{472}</a></span>
do I find in my Expence, that I can make it appear,
from the Accounts now in being, in only those four Families
at <i>London</i>, <i>Bristol</i>, <i>Kingswood</i>, and <i>Newcastle</i>, I save upwards
of fifty Pounds a Year.</p>

<p>The first to whom I explained these Things at large, and whom
I advised to set the same Example to their Brethren, were, a
few of those, who rejoice to assist my Brother and me, as our
Sons in the Gospel. A Week after I proposed it to about
forty of those, whom I believed to be strong in Faith: And to
the next Morning to about sixty more, intreating them all, to
speak their Minds freely. They did so: and in the End, saw
the Good which might insue; yielded to the Force of Scripture
and Reason: And resolved all (but two or three) by the Grace
of <span class="smcap">God</span>, to make the Trial without Delay.</p>

<p>If you are sincere in this Plea; if you do not <i>talk</i> of your
Health, while the real Objection is your Inclination, make a
fair Trial thus, 1. Take half a Pint of Milk every Morning, with
a little Bread, not boiled, but warmed only; (a Man in tolerable
Health might double the Quantity.) 2. If this is too
heavy, add as much Water, and boil it together with a Spoonful
of Oatmeal. 3. If this agrees not, try half a Pint, or a little
more, of Water-gruel, neither thick nor thin; not sweetened
(for that may be apt to make you sick) but with a very little
Butter, Salt, and Bread. 4. If this disagrees, try Sage, green
Balm, Mint, or Pennyroyal Tea, infusing only so much of the
Herb as just to change the Colour of the Water. 5. Try two
or three of these mixed, in various Proportions. 6. Try ten or
twelve other <i>English</i> Herbs. 7. Try <i>Foltron</i>, a Mixture of
Herbs to be had at many Grocers, far healthier as well as
cheaper than Tea. 8. Try Coco. If after having tried each of
these, for a Week or ten Days, you find none of them well
agree with your Constitution, then use (weak Green) Tea again:
But at the same Time know, That your having used it so long
has brought you near the Chambers of Death.</p></blockquote>

<p>The still-room was of the greatest importance to the
housewife. She no longer distilled strong waters for
cordials, but she made her preserves and her pickles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">{473}</a></span>
She made rose-water, and lavender-water, and hysterical-water;
Plague-water, angelica-water, and all kinds
of wonderful waters, whose names and virtues are now
quite forgotten. The horror of the Plague, which survived
to a hundred years ago, is shown by the extraordinary
complications of the Plague-mixture. We
are to take a pound each of twenty roots, sixteen
flowers, nineteen seeds; we are to take also an ounce
each of nutmeg, cloves, and mace; we are to shred the
flowers, bruise the berries, and pound the roots and
spices; to these we must add a peck of green walnuts;
after mixing all together they must be steeped in wine
lees; after a week they must be distilled.</p>

<p>She also made cherry-brandy, currant-gin, damson-brandy,
and certain medicinal wines or confections, of
which the following is a specimen. It is called Gascony
wine. It comforts the vital parts, cures dropsy,
and keeps the old alive. Yet we have neglected so
sovereign a medicine!</p>

<p>"Take ginger, galingale, cinnamon, nutmeg, grains
of paradise, cloves bruised, fennel seed, caraway seeds,
origanum, one ounce each. Next, take sage, wild marjorum,
pennyroyal, mint, red roses, thyme, pellitory,
rosemary, wild thyme, camomile, lavender, one handful
of each. Beat the spices small, bruise the herbs, put
all into a limbeck with wine for twelve hours; then
distil."</p>

<p>The great thing was to have as many ingredients as
possible. Thus the Plague-water took fifty-nine ingredients;
the famous water called "Mithridate" took
forty-six; and the Venice treacle, sixty-two. When
they were once made, they were warranted to "rectify
and maintain the body, clarify the blood, surfle the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">{474}</a></span>
cheek, perfume the skin, tinct the hair, and lengthen
the appetite."</p>

<p>The London citizen of the lower class never called
in a physician unless he was in immediate danger; the
herbalist physicked him, and the wise woman. Very
often his own wife was an abyss of learning as to herbs
and their properties; the bone-setter belonged to a
distinct branch of the medical profession. There were
apothecaries who prescribed as well as sold drugs.
For instance, early in the century, one Dalmahoy kept
a shop on Ludgate Hill, where he sold, among other
things, drugs, potions, electuaries, powders, sweetmeats,
washes for the complexion, scented hair-oil pomades,
dentifrices, love charms, Italian masks to sleep in,
spermaceti salt, and scammony squills. And the doctor
who wished to attract the confidence of citizens
found a little stage management useful. He wore
black, of course, with a huge wig; he carried a gold-headed
cane, with a pomander box on the top; he
kept his hands always in a muff, so that they might be
soft, warm to the touch, and delicate; he hung his
consulting-room with looking-glasses, and he littered
it with vials; he had on the mantel-shelf a skull, and
hanging to the wall the skeleton of a monkey; on his
table stood a folio in Greek; and he preserved a Castilian
gravity of countenance. Besides the physician,
the apothecary, the herbalist, and the wise woman,
there was the barber-surgeon. His pole was twined
with colors three&mdash;white, red, and blue. But I know
not how long into the century the alliance of surgeon
and barber continued.</p>

<p>One must not overlook the quack, who plays such a
conspicuous part in the last century. There was certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">{475}</a></span>
one quack&mdash;and sometimes half a dozen&mdash;at
every fair. Some of them went about with a simple
caravan, pulling teeth and selling potions and pills
and powders warranted to cure every disorder. Some
of them, more ambitious, drove round the country in
coaches. They dressed in great wigs and black velvet;
they had a stage in front of their consulting-rooms, on
which a mountebank tumbled, a girl danced on the
tight-rope, and a band of music played. And the people
believed in them, just as they believe nowadays in the
fellow who advertises his pills or his powders, certain
to cure everybody. It is only changing the coach, the
caravan, and the stage for the advertisement columns,
with no more expense for travelling, horses, mountebank,
or music. It is just the same whether we sell
"angelic snuff" that will cure most things, or "royal
snuff" that will cure the rest, or electuaries, or distilled
and medicated water that will even make an old
wig new.</p>

<p>One who has looked at Mrs. Glasse's wonderful
book on cookery, and reflects upon the variety and
wealth of dishes which then graced the board, would
not lightly approach the subject of food. Yet there
are a few <i>plats</i>, favorites with the people, which may
be noticed. Sage tea, for instance, with bread-and-butter,
is no longer taken for breakfast; and some of
the following dishes have disappeared: Hasty pudding,
made of flour and water boiled together, to which dabs
of butter and spoonfuls of brown sugar were added
when it was poured out of the pot&mdash;no one now ever
sees sugar quite so brown as that which the West Indies
used to send over a hundred and fifty years ago.
Onion pottage has assumed the more complex form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">{476}</a></span>
of soup. A bean tansy was once universally beloved;
there were two forms of it; in the first, after bruising
your beans, you put them in a dish with pepper, salt,
cloves, mace, the yolks of six eggs, a quarter of a
pound of butter, and some slices of bacon. This you
baked. The other form was when you mixed beans,
biscuits, sugar, sack, cream, and baked all in a dish
with garnish of candied orange-peel. There were
drinks in endless variety, such as purl, Old Pharaoh,
knock-down, humtie-dumtie, stipple shouldrée&mdash;names
in this degenerate age, and nothing more. We can
hardly understand, either, the various possets, punch
in its hundred and fifty branches, raw shrub&mdash;which
still stands in old-fashioned bars&mdash;and the various
cups, porter cup, cider cup, port-wine cup, egg flip,
rum-booze, and the rest.</p>

<p>The drinking of the last century went far beyond
anything ever recorded; all classes alike drank; they
began to drink hard somewhere about the year 1730,
and they kept it up for a hundred years with great
spirit and admirable results, which we, their grandchildren,
are now illustrating. The clergy, grave and
sober merchants, lawyers, judges, the most responsible
people, drank freely; men about town, officers,
Templars, tradesmen drank more than freely; the lowest
classes spent all their money in drink, especially in
gin, upon which they could get drunk for twopence.
In the year 1736 there were 7044 gin-shops in London&mdash;one
house in six&mdash;and 3200 ale-houses where gin
was secretly sold. The people all went mad after gin.
The dinner-hour was at two for the better sort. Mrs.
Glasse plainly shows that the living was extremely
good, and that expense among people in easy circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">{477}</a></span>
was not much regarded where the table was
concerned. Certain dishes, as in Tudor days, belonged
to certain days, as veal and a gammon of bacon and
a tansy pudding on Easter Day, or a roast goose at
Michaelmas; red herrings and salt-fish, with leeks,
parsnips, and pease in Lent; at Martinmas, salt-beef;
at Midsummer, roast beef with butter and beans; at
All Saints, pork and souse, "spats and spurling."
They were great at puddings&mdash;one may find many an
excellent receipt, long since forgotten, in Mrs. Glasse.
For dessert they had sweetmeats, fruits, liqueurs, such
as <i>ros solis</i>, rich wines, such as Lisbon and Madeira,
or, where there were men in company, port. In the
morning they drank tea and chocolate. It is pretty
clear that the real business of the day was done before
dinner. That, in fact, was the custom up to
twenty years ago in certain Yorkshire towns, where
everybody dined at two o'clock. The clerks were
practically left to take care of the offices in the afternoon,
and the masters sat over their wine. It must,
one reflects, be a large business indeed where the masters
cannot get through their share by two o'clock.</p>

<p>In the evening every man had his club or coffee-house.
We know that Dr. Johnson was unhappy unless
he had a club for the evening. There were clubs
for every class: they met at taverns, they gradually
superseded the coffee-houses for evening purposes.
The City coffee-houses, however, became places where
a great deal of business was carried on. Thus, at the
Baltic was a subscription-room for merchants and
brokers engaged in the Russia trade; the Chapter, of
Paternoster Row, was the resort of booksellers; the
Jamaica was a house of West Indian trade; Garraway's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">{478}</a></span>
Robins's, Jonathan's, the Jerusalem, Lloyd's,
were all City coffee-houses turned into rendezvous for
merchants. The clubs of the last century deserve a
separate paper for themselves. The London citizen
went to his club every evening. He there solemnly
discussed the news of the day, smoked his pipe of tobacco,
drank his punch, and went home by ten o'clock.
The club was the social life of the City. For the
ladies there was their own social life. Women lived
much more with other
women; they had their
visits and society among
each other in the daytime.
While the men
worked at their shops
and offices, the women
gadded about; in the
evening they sat at
home while the men
went out. In one family
of my acquaintance there is a tradition belonging
to the end of the last century, that when the then
head of the house came home at ten the girls all hurried
off to bed, the reason being that the good man's
temper at the late hour, what with the fatigues of
the day and the punch of the evening, was by no
means uncertain.</p>

<p>A manuscript diary of a middle-class family belonging
to the time of George the First shows anything
but a stay-at-home life. The ladies were always going
about. But they stayed at home in the evenings.
There was a very good reason why the women should
stay at home. The streets were infested with prowling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">{479}</a></span>
thieves and with dangerous bullies: no woman could go
out after dark in the City without an armed escort of
her father's apprentices or his men-servants. In 1744
the Lord Mayor complains that "confederacies of
evil-disposed persons, armed with bludgeons, pistols,
and cutlasses, infest lanes and private passages," and
issue forth to rob and wound peaceful people. Further,
that these gangs have defeated, wounded, and
killed the officers of justice sent against them. As
yet they had not arrived at the simple expedient of
strengthening the police.</p>

<p>As for the dangers of venturing out after dark, they
are summed up by Jonson:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Prepare for death if here at night you roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sign your will before you step from home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some fiery fop, with new commission vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sleeps in brambles till he kills his man&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some frolic drunkard reeling from a feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Provokes a broil and stabs you for a jest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet even these heroes mischievously gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lords of the street and terrors of the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flushed as they are with folly, youth, and wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their prudent insults to the poor confine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Afar they mark the flambeau's bright approach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shun the shining train and golden coach."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The occupations of a young lady&mdash;not a lady of the
highest fashion&mdash;of this time are given by a contemporary
writer. He says that she makes tippets, works
handkerchiefs in catgut, collects shells, makes grottoes,
copies music, paints, cuts out figures and landscapes,
and makes screens. She dances a minuet or
cotillion, and she can play ombre, lansquenet, quadrille,
and Pope Joan. These are frivolous accomplishments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">{480}</a></span>
but the writer says nothing of the morning's
work&mdash;the distilling of creams, the confecting of cakes
and puddings and sauces, the needle-work, and all the
useful things. When these were done, why should
not the poor girl show her accomplishments and taste
in the cutting out of landscapes with a pair of scissors?</p>

<p>They certainly did not always stay at home. In
the summer they sometimes went to Vauxhall, where
the girls enjoyed the sight of the wicked world as
much as they liked, the singing and the supper and
the punch that followed.</p>

<p>We have quite lost the mug-house. This was a kind
of music-hall, a large room where only men were admitted,
and where ale or stout was the only drink
consumed. Every man had his pipe; there was a
president, a harp was played at one end of the room,
and out of the company present one after the other
stood up to sing. Between the songs there were toasts
and speeches, sometimes of a political kind, and the
people drank to each other from table to table.</p>

<p>It was a great fighting time. Every man who went
abroad knew that he might have to fight to defend
himself against footpad or bully. Most men carried
a stout stick. When Dr. Johnson heard that a man
had threatened to horsewhip him, he ordered a thick
cudgel and was easy in his mind. There were no police,
and therefore a man had to fight. It cannot be
doubted that the martial spirit of the country, which
during the whole century was extraordinary, was greatly
maintained by the practice of fighting, which prevailed
alike in all ranks. Too much order is not all
pure gain. If we have got rid of the Mohocks and
street scourers, we have lost a good deal of that readiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">{481}</a></span>
to fight which firmly met those Mohocks and
made them fly.</p>

<p>I suppose that one can become accustomed to
everything. But the gibbets which one saw stuck up
everywhere, along the Edgeware Road, on the river-side,
on Blackheath, on Hampstead Heath, or Kennington
Common, must have been an unpleasing sight.
Some of the gibbets remained until early in this
century.</p>

<p>The subject of beer is of world-wide importance. It
must be understood that all through the century the
mystery of brewing was continually advancing. We
finally shook off the heresies of broom, bay-berries,
and ivy-berries as flavoring things for beer; we perfected
the manufacture of stout. There sprang up
during the century what hardly existed before&mdash;a critical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">{482}</a></span>
feeling for beer. It may be found in the poets
and in the novelists. Goldsmith has it; Fielding has
it. There were over fifty brewers in London, where,
as a national drink, it entirely displaced wine. The
inns vied with each other in the excellence of their
tap,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where the Red Lion, staring o'er the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invites each passing stranger that can pay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Calvert's broth and Parsons' black champagne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regale the drabs and bloods of Drury Lane."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There were many houses where every night there was
singing and playing, to the accompaniment of beer
alone; and there was at least one famous debating club&mdash;the
Robin Hood&mdash;where stout was the only drink
permissible.</p>

<p>Here are one or two notes of domestic interest. The
washing of the house was always done at home. And,
which was a very curious custom, the washer-woman
began her work at midnight. Why this was so ordered,
I know not; but there must have been some reason.
During the many wars of the century wheat went up
to an incredible price. One year it was 104s. a quarter,
so that bread was three times as dear as it is at
present. Housewives in those times cut their bread
with their own hands, and kept it until it was stale. If
you wanted a place under Government, you could buy
one; the sum of £500 would get you a comfortable
berth in the Victualling Office, for instance, where the
perquisites, pickings, and bribes for contracts made the
service worth having. Members of Parliament, who
had the privilege of franking letters, sometimes sold
the right for £300 a year. Ale-houses were marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">{483}</a></span>
by chequers on the door-post&mdash;to this day the Chequers
is a common tavern sign. Bakers had a lattice at their
doors. All tradesmen&mdash;not servants only, but master
tradesmen&mdash;asked for Christmas-boxes. The Fleet
weddings went on merrily. There was great feasting
on the occasion of a wedding, duly conducted in the
parish church. On the day of the wedding the bridegroom
himself waited on bride and guests.</p>

<p>If the married couple were city people, they were
regaled after the ceremony with the marrow-bones and
cleavers&mdash;perhaps the most delectable music ever invented.
It was also costly, because the musicians
wanted drink, and plenty of it, as well as money.</p>

<p>Nothing seems grander than to hear of a city illuminated
in honor of a victory or peace, or the King's
birthday. For the most part, however, the grand illumination
consisted of nothing but a thin candle stuck
in a lump of clay in the window.</p>

<p>In the days before the policeman there was a good
deal of rough-and-ready justice done in the streets&mdash;pickpockets
were held under the pump till they were
half-dead; informers were pelted through the streets,
tarred, and feathered; those worthy citizens who beat
their wives were serenaded with pots and pans, and
had to endure the cries of indignant matrons. The
stocks were always in view; the pillory was constantly
in use. Now, the pillory was essentially punishment
by the people; if they sympathized with the
culprit, he escaped even disgrace; if they condemned
him, addled eggs, rotten potatoes, turnips, dead cats,
mud and filth, flying in his face, proclaimed aloud the
opinion of the people.</p>

<p>One thing more&mdash;the universal patten. When women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">{484}</a></span>
went abroad all wore pattens; it was a sensible fashion
in days of bad pavements and muddy crossings, as
Gay wrote kindly, yet with doubtful philology:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The patten now supports each frugal dame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which from the blue-eyed Patty takes the name."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was also great expense and ostentation observed
at funerals; every little shopkeeper, it was
observed, must have a hearse and half a dozen mourning-coaches
to be carried a hundred yards to the parish
church-yard. They were often conducted at night,
in order to set off the ceremony by hired mourners
bearing flambeaux.</p>

<p>The amount of flogging in the army and navy is
appalling to think of. That carried on ashore is a
subject of some obscurity. The punishment of whipping
has never been taken out of our laws. Garroters,
and robbers who are violent are still flogged, and
boys are birched. I know not when they ceased to
flog men through the streets at the cart-tail, nor when
they left off flogging women. The practice certainly
continued well into the century. In the prisons it
was a common thing to flog the men. As for the severity
of the laws protecting property, one illustration
will suffice. What can be thought of laws which allowed
the hanging of two children for stealing a purse
with two shillings and a brass counter in it? Something,
however, may be said for Father Stick. He
ordered everything, directed everything, superintended
everything. Without him nothing was ever done;
nothing could be done. Men were flogged into drill
and discipline, they were flogged into courage, they
were flogged into obedience, boys were flogged into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">{485}</a></span>
learning, prentices were flogged into diligence, women
were flogged into virtue. Father Stick has still his
disciples, but in the last century he was king.</p>

<p>We have spoken of station and order. It must be
remembered that there was then no pretence of a clerk,
or any one of that kind, calling himself a gentleman.
Steele, however, notes the attempts made by small
people to dub themselves esquire, and says we shall
soon be a nation of <i>armigeri</i>. The Georgian clerk
was a servant&mdash;the servant of his master, and a very
faithful servant, too, for the most part. His services
were rewarded at a rate of pay varying from £20 to
£100 a year. A clerk in a Government office seldom
got more than £50, but some of them had chances of
a kind which we now call dishonest. In other words,
they took perquisites, commissions, considerations,
and bribes.</p>

<p>I have said, elsewhere, that the London craftsman
sank about this time to the lowest level he has ever
reached. In the City itself, as we have seen, he was
carefully looked after. Each little parish consisted of
two or three streets, where every resident was well
known. But already the narrow bounds of the Freedom
had pushed out the people more and more. The
masters&mdash;the merchants and retailers&mdash;still remained;
those who were pushed out were the craftsmen. When
they left the City they not only left the parish where
all were friends&mdash;all, at least, belonging to the same
ship's crew; where there was a kindly feeling towards
the poor; where the boys and girls were taught the
ways of virtue and the Catechism&mdash;they left the company,
to which they were no longer apprenticed, and
which became nothing but a rich company of masters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">{486}</a></span>
or men unconnected with the trade; they left the
Church; they left the school; they left all the charities,
helps, encouragements which had formerly belonged
to them. They went to Whitechapel, to St.
Katherine's Precinct, to Spital Fields, to Clerkenwell.
They lived by themselves, knowing no law except the
law of necessity, and they drank&mdash;drank&mdash;drank. No
energetic vicar, no active young curate, no deaconess,
no Sister, no Bible-woman ventured among them.
They went forth in the morning to their work, and in
the evening they returned home to their dens. We
read about these people in Fielding, Smollett, Colquhoun,
Eden, and others; we see what they were like
in Hogarth. Their very brutality rendered them
harmless. Had they been a little less brutal, a little
more intelligent&mdash;had they been like the lower sort of
Parisian, there might have been a revolution in this
country with brutalities as bad as any that marked
the first act in that great drama played between 1792
and 1815.</p>

<p>The seamy side of London in the last century has
been laid bare by one writer after another. Because
it seems more picturesque than the daily humdrum
life of honest folk it is always chosen in preference to
the latter. Gentlemen who live by their wits are
common in every age; they adorn the Victorian as
much as the Elizabethan period. The rogue is always
with us. There are, however, as we have seen, varieties
belonging to each period. Thus the kidnapper,
who has now left these islands, was formerly a very
common variety of rogue. He was sometimes called
crimp, sometimes kidnapper, and his trade was the
procuring of recruits. In time of war he enlisted for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">{487}</a></span>
the army and the navy, and in time of peace for the
merchant service and the East India Company's. He
carried on his business with all the tricks and dodges
which suggested themselves to an ingenious mind,
but his favorite way of working was this: He prowled
about places where young countrymen might be found.
One presently appeared who had come to town on
business or for amusement. He lent a willing ear to
the courteous and friendly stranger who so kindly advised
him as to the sights and the dangers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">{488}</a></span>
wicked town. He readily followed when the stranger
proposed a glass in an honest tavern, which could be
highly recommended. He sat down without suspicion
in a parlor where there were two or three of the right
sort, together with two gallant fellows in uniforms,
sergeants of the grenadiers, or bo's'ns in the E. I. C.
service. He listened while these heroes recounted
their deeds of valor; he listened with open mouth;
and, alas! he drank with open mouth as well. Presently
he became so inflamed with the liquor that he
acceded to the sergeant's invitation, and took the
bounty money then and there. If he did not, he
drank on until he was speechless. When he recovered
next day, his friend&mdash;the courteous stranger of
the day before&mdash;was present to remind him that he
had enlisted, that the bounty money was in his pocket,
and that the cockade was on his hat. If he resisted
he was hauled before a magistrate, the sergeants
being ready to prove that he voluntarily enlisted.
This done, he was conducted to a crimp's house, of
which there were many in different parts of London,
and there kept until he could be put on board or taken
to some military depot. In the house, which was
barred and locked like a prison, he was regaled with
rum which kept him stupid and senseless. Should
he try to escape, he was charged with robbery and
hanged.</p>

<p>The continual succession of wars enriched London
with that delightful character, the man who had
served in the army&mdash;perhaps borne his Majesty's commission&mdash;and
had returned to live, not by his wits,
because he had none, but by his strength of arm, his
skill of fence, and his powers of bluster. He became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">{489}</a></span>
the bully. As such he was either the Darby Captain,
who was paid to be the gaming-house bully, or the
Cock and Bottle Captain, who was the ale-house
bully, and fought bailiffs for his friends; or the Tash
Captain, who now has another name, and may be
found near Coventry Street.</p>

<p>The Setter played a game which brought in great
gains, but was extremely difficult and delicate. He
was the agent for ladies whose reputations were&mdash;let
us say unjustly&mdash;cracked. His object was to restore
them to society by honorable marriage, and not only
to society, but also to position, credit, and luxury. A
noble ambition! He therefore frequented the coffee-houses,
the bagnios, and the gambling places on the
lookout for heirs and eldest sons, or, if possible, young
men of wealth and position. Of course they must be
without experience. He would thus endeavor to obtain
the confidence of his victim until it became safe
to introduce him to the beautiful young widow of
good family, and so on; the rest we may guess. Sometimes,
of course, the young heir was a young fortune-hunter,
who married the widow of large fortune only
to find that she was a penniless adventuress with
nothing but debts, which he thus took upon himself
and paid by a life-long imprisonment in the Fleet.</p>

<p>The travelling quack we have considered. There
was another kind who was stationary and had a good
house in the City. This kind cured by sympathy, by
traction, by earth-bathing, by sea-bathing, by the quintessence
of Bohea tea and cocoanuts distilled together,
by drugs, and by potions. He advertised freely, he
drove about ostentatiously in a glass coach; he had
all kinds of tricks to arrest attention&mdash;for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">{490}</a></span>
the Goddess of Hygeia was to be seen by all callers
daily, at the house of the great Dr. Graham. The
cruel persecution of the College of Physicians has extinguished
the quack, who, if he now exists, must have
first passed the examinations required by the regular
practitioner.</p>

<p>The bogus auction has always been a favorite
method of getting quick returns and a rapid turnover.
It is not now so common as formerly, but it
still exists.</p>

<p>The intelligence office, where you paid a shilling
and were promised a place of great profit, and were
called upon for another shilling and still another, and
then got nothing, is now called an agency, and is said
to flourish very well indeed.</p>

<p>The pretended old friend, who was a common character
in 1760, has, I am told, crossed the ocean and
changed his name. He is now a naturalized citizen
of the United States, and his name is Bunco Steerer.</p>

<p>Let me add to this account&mdash;too scanty and meagre&mdash;of
London in the last century a brief narrative&mdash;borrowed,
not invented&mdash;of a Sunday holiday. It has
been seen that the City was careful about the church-going
of the citizens. But laws were forgotten, manners
relaxed; outside the City no such discipline was
possible, nor was any attempted. And to the people
within the walls, as well as to those without, Sunday
gradually became a day of holiday and pleasure. You
shall see what a day was made of a certain Sunday in
the summer of 17&mdash; by a pair of citizens whose names
have perished.</p>

<p>The holiday makers slept at the Marlborough Head,
in Bishopsgate Street, whence they sallied forth at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">{491}</a></span>
four in the morning. Early as it was, the gates of
the inn-yards were thronged with young people gayly
dressed, waiting for the horses, chaises, and carriages
which were to carry them to Windsor, Hampton
Court, Richmond, etc., for the day. They were mostly
journeymen or apprentices, and the ladies with
them were young milliners and mantua-makers. They
first walked westward, making for the Foundling Hospital,
on their way passing a rabble rout drinking saloop
and fighting. Arrived at the fields lying south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">{492}</a></span>
of that institution, they met with a company of servants,
men and girls, who had stolen some of their
masters' wine, and were out in the fields to drink it.
They shared in the drink, but deplored the crime. It
will be observed, as we go along, that a very creditable
amount of drink accompanied this holiday. Then
they continued walking across the fields till they came
to Tottenham Court Road, where the Wesleyans, in
their tabernacle, were holding an early service. Outside
the chapel a prize-fight was going on, with a
crowd of ruffians and betting men. It was, however,
fought on the cross.</p>

<p>They next retraced their steps across the fields and
arrived at Bagnigge Wells, which lay at the east of
the Gray's Inn Road, nearly opposite what is now
Mecklenburgh Square, and north-east of the St. Andrew's
Burying-ground. Early as it was, the place
already contained several hundreds of people. The
Wells included a great room for concerts and entertainments,
a garden planted with trees, shrubs, and
flowers, and provided with walks, a fish-pond, fountain,
rustic bridge, rural cottages, and seats. The admission
was threepence. They had appointed to
breakfast at the Bank Coffee-house, therefore they
could not wait longer here. On the way to the City
they stopped at the Thatched House and took a gill
of red port.</p>

<p>The Bank Coffee-house was filled with people taking
breakfast and discussing politics or trade. It is
not stated what they had for breakfast, but as one of
the company is spoken of as finishing his dish of
chocolate, it may be imagined that this was the usual
drink. A lovely barmaid smiled farewell when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">{493}</a></span>
left the place. From this coffee-house they went to
church at St. Mary-le-Strand, where a bishop preached
a charity sermon. At the close of the sermon the
charity children were placed at the doors, loudly imploring
the benefactions of the people. After church
they naturally wanted a
little refreshment; they
therefore went to a house
near St. Paul's, where the
landlord provided them
a cold collation with a
pint of Lisbon.</p>

<p>The day being fine,
they agreed to walk to
Highgate and to dine at
the ordinary there. On
the way they were beset
by beggars in immense
numbers. They arrived
at Highgate just in time
for the dinner&mdash;probably
at two o'clock. The company consisted principally
of reputable tradesmen and their families.
There was an Italian musician, a gallery reporter&mdash;that
is, a man who attended the House and wrote
down the debates from memory&mdash;and a lawyer's clerk.
The ordinary consisted of two or three dishes and
cost a shilling each. They had a bottle of wine and
sat till three o'clock, when they left the tavern and
walked to Primrose Hill. Here they met an acquaintance
in the shape of an Eastcheap cheesemonger, who
was dragging his children in a four-wheel chaise up
the hill, while his wife carried the good man's wig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">{494}</a></span>
and hat on the point of his walking-stick. The hill
was crowded with people of all kinds.</p>

<p>When they had seen enough they came away and
walked to the top of Hampstead Hill. Here, at the
famous Spaniard's, they rested and took a bottle of
port.</p>

<p>It was five o'clock in the afternoon when they left
Hampstead and made for Islington, intending to see
the White Conduit House on their way to the Surrey
side.</p>

<p>All these gardens&mdash;to leave these travellers for a
moment&mdash;Ranelagh, Vauxhall, Bagnigge Wells, and
the rest, were alike. They contained a concert and a
promenade room, a garden laid out in pleasing walks,
a fish-pond with arbors, and rooms for suppers, a
fountain, a band of music, and a dancing-floor. The
amusements of Ranelagh are thus described by a visitor
who dropped into verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To Ranelagh, once in my life,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By good-natured force I was driven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nations had ceased from their strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And peace beamed her radiance from heaven.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"(I stop to apologize for these two lines; but everybody knows
that <i>strife</i> and <i>heaven</i> are very neat rhymes of <i>life</i> and <i>driven</i>.
Otherwise I admit that they have nothing to do with Ranelagh.)</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What wonders were there to be found<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That a clown might enjoy or disdain?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First we traced the gay circle around,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And then we went round it again.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A thousand feet rustled on mats&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A carpet that once had been green;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">{495}</a></span>
<span class="i0">Men bowed with their outlandish hats,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With women so fearfully keen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair maids, who, at home in their haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had left all their clothes but a train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swept the floor clean as they passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then walked round and swept it again."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At these gardens this Sunday afternoon there were
several hundreds of people, not of the more distinguished
kind. They found a very pretty girl here
who was so condescending as to take tea with them.</p>

<p>Leaving the Conduit House, they paid another visit
to Bagnigge Wells in order to drink a bowl of negus.
By this time the place was a scene of open profligacy.
They next called a coach, and drove to Kensington
Gardens, where they walked about for an hour
seeing the great people. Among others, they had the
happiness of beholding the <span class="nobr">D&mdash;</span> of <span class="nobr">Gr-ft-n</span>, accompanied
by Miss <span class="nobr">P&mdash;</span>, and <span class="nobr">L&mdash;d</span> <span class="nobr">H&mdash;y</span> with the famous
Mrs. <span class="nobr">W&mdash;</span>. Feeling the want of a little refreshment,
they sought a tea-garden in Brompton known as
Cromwell's Gardens or Florida Gardens, where they
drank coffee, and contemplated the beauty of many
lovely creatures.</p>

<p>It was now nine o'clock in the evening. In the
neighborhood of the Mall they saw a great block of
carriages on their way to Lady <span class="nobr">H&mdash;'s</span> Sunday routs.
The explorers then visited certain houses frequented
by the baser sort, and were rewarded in the manner
that might have been expected&mdash;namely, with ribaldry
and blasphemy. As the clock struck ten they arrived
at the Dog and Duck, St. George's Fields. From
the Dog and Duck they repaired to The Temple of
Flora, a place of the same description as Bagnigge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">{496}</a></span>
Wells. Here, as the magistrates had refused a wine
license, they kept a citizen and vintner on the premises.
He, by virtue of his livery, had the right to sell
wine without a license. Our friends took a bottle
here. The Apollo Gardens, the Thatched House, the
Flora Tea-garden, were also places of resort of the
same kind, all with a garden, tea and music rooms,
and a company of doubtful morals. They drove next
to the Bermondsey Spa Gardens, described as an elegant
place of entertainment, two miles from London
Bridge, with a walk hung with colored lamps not inferior
to that of Vauxhall. There was also a lovely
pasteboard castle and a museum of curiosities. They
had another bottle here, and a comfortable glass of
cherry-brandy before getting into the carriage. Finally
they reached the place whence they started at
midnight, and after a final bumper of red port retired
to rest. A noble Sunday, lasting from four o'clock in
the morning till midnight. They walked twenty miles
at least; they drank all day long&mdash;port, Lisbon, chocolate,
negus, tea, coffee, and cherry-brandy, besides their
beer at dinner. On nine different occasions they
called for a pint or a bottle. A truly wonderful and
improving Sunday!</p>

<p>A chapter on Georgian London would be incomplete
indeed which failed to notice the institution
which plays so large a part in the literature of the
period&mdash;the debtors' prison. Strange it seems to us
who have only recently reformed in this matter, that
a man should be locked up for life because he was
unable to pay a trifling debt, or even a heavy debt.
Everybody knows the Fleet, with its racquet courts
and its prisoners; everybody knows the King's Bench,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">{497}</a></span>
and the Marshalsea also is familiar to us. Here, however,
is a picture of Wood Street Compter, which is
not so well known. In this place, one of the two City
Compters under the sheriffs, were confined not only
debtors, but also persons charged with night assaults&mdash;men
or women&mdash;and felons and common thieves,
the latter perhaps when Newgate was full. For these
there was the strong room, in which men and women
were locked up together, unless they could afford a
separate room, for which they paid two shillings a
night before commitment, and one shilling a night
after. On the master's side, those of the debtors who
could afford to pay for them had separate rooms, but
miserably furnished; on the common side there were
two wards. In one of these, which was nearly dark
and called the Hole, shelves were arranged along the
wall like the bunks in a cabin; here those who had
any beds laid them, those who had none slept on the
bare shelf. This was the living-room and the cooking-room,
as well as the sleeping-room. The smell of
the place, the narrator says, was intolerable. In the
second ward of the common side lived those a little
removed from destitution, who could pay fifteen pence
a week for the accommodation of a bed. Otherwise
it was the same as the first ward. The women had a
separate ward. There was a drinking-bar here in a
kind of cellar&mdash;"the place full of ill smells and every
inconvenience that man could conceive." Quarrels,
fightings, and brawls were punished by black hole.
Men in prison on charge of night assaults were called
rats; women under similar charges were called mice.</p>

<p>It seems as if life under such conditions must have
been intolerable. Never to be alone, never to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">{498}</a></span>
clean, never to be quiet, never to be free from the
smell of bad cooking, confined rooms, stale tobacco,
vile spirits; never to be free from the society of vile
men; this was the punishment for those who could
not pay their debts. Wood Street Compter was removed
to Giltspur Street in 1791.</p>

<p>The subject of Fleet weddings has been treated at
length in a certain novel founded on one of them.
They did not altogether belong to the baser sort, or
to the more profligate sort. Many a young citizen
arranged with his mistress to take her secretly to the
Fleet, there to marry her, then back again and on
their knees to the parents. This saved the expense
of the wedding-feast, which was almost as great as
that of the funeral-feast.</p>

<p>As to trade, it was marching in giant strides, such
as even good old Sir Thomas Gresham had not considered
possible. The increase of trade belongs to
the historian; we have only to notice the great warehouses
along Thames Street, the quays and wharves,
the barges and lighters, the ships lying two miles in
length in two long lines below bridge, the crowd of
stevedores, watermen, lightermen, the never-ending
turmoil of those who loaded and unloaded the ships,
the solid, sober merchants dressed in brown cloth,
with white silk stockings and white lace ruffles and
neckerchiefs. They are growing rich&mdash;they are growing
very rich. London has long been the richest city
in the world.</p>

<p>These notes are wholly insufficient to show the
London of George, the Second. They illustrate the
daily life of the citizens; they also show something of
the brutality, the drunkenness, and the rough side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">{499}</a></span>
the lower levels. The better side of London&mdash;that of
the scholars, divines, writers, and professional men&mdash;comes
out fully in the memoirs and letters of the period,
which are fortunately abundant. There we can
find the stately courtesy of the better sort, the dignity,
the respect to rank, the exaction of respect, the
social gradations which were recognized by those
above as well as those below, the religion which was
partly formal and partly touched with the old Puritanic
spirit, the benevolence and the charity of the
upper class, coupled with their determination that
those below shall never be allowed to combine, the
survival of old traditions, and all the other points
which make us love this century so much. If any
notes on London of this period omitted mention of
these points, they would be inadequate indeed.</p>

<p>These notes&mdash;these chapters&mdash;to conclude, make
no pretence to show more than the City life; which
was decorous at all times, and especially during the
last century. Of the wickedness, goodness, vice, and
virtue that went on at the court, and among the aristocracy
from age to age, nothing has been said. The
moralist has plenty to say on this subject. Unfortunately,
the moralist always picks out the worst cases,
and wants us to believe that they are average specimens.
A good deal might be said, I am of opinion,
on the other side, in considering the many virtues;
the courage, loyalty, moderation, and the sense of
honor which has always distinguished the better sort
among the nobility.</p>

<hr style='margin-left:27.5%; width:45%'/>

<p>We have seen London from age to age. It has
changed indeed. Yet in one thing it has shown no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">{500}</a></span>
change. London has always been a city looking forward,
pressing forward, fighting for the future, using
up the present ruthlessly for the sake of the future,
trampling on the past. As it has been, so it is. The
City may have reached its highest point; it may be
about to decline; but as yet it shows no sign, it has
sounded no note of decay, or of decline, or of growing
age. The City, which began with the East Saxon settlement
among the forsaken streets thirteen hundred
years ago, is still in the full strength and lustihood of
manhood&mdash;perhaps as yet it is only early manhood.
For which, as in private duty bound, let us laud,
praise, and magnify the Providence which has so
guided the steps of the citizens, and so filled their
hearts, from generation to generation, with the spirit
of self-reliance, hope, and courage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">{501}</a></span></p>

Smalley</span>, London Correspondent of the <i>New York Tribune</i>.
Two Volumes. 8vo, Cloth, Uncut Edges and Gilt Tops, $6 00.</p>

<blockquote><p>Have an enduring value for the twofold reason that they discuss

soon fade from the public eye, and that the literary nature of them is
strong and charming.&mdash;<i>N. Y. Sun.</i></p></blockquote>

Letter-press by <span class="smcap">Blanchard Jerrold</span>. Folio, Cloth, $5 00.</p>

<blockquote><p>The highways and byways of London offered as appropriate a provocation
for the exercise of Doré's weird and grotesque imagination as this
powerful artist had already found in Dante's "Inferno," Rabelais, the
"Legend of the Wandering Jew," and the other works familiar to the
public in his illustrated editions.</p></blockquote>

and Characteristic Illustrations by Cruikshank and
others. 8vo, Cloth, $2 50.</p>

and vital picture of the social, political, religious, and literary world of
half a century ago.&mdash;<i>Critic</i>, N. Y.</p></blockquote>
